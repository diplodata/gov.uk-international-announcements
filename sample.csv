<p>Today (20 September) it was announced that BBC Children in Need will be partnering with The Royal Mint and HM Treasury on their £1 coin campaign, joining forces for Pudsey’s Round Pound Countdown.</p>

<p>Kicking off a nationwide campaign, BBC Children in Need, The Royal Mint and HM Treasury will challenge the country to join Pudsey to hunt down the millions of remaining round £1 coins, and put them to good use by donating to BBC Children in Need.</p>

<p>With less than four weeks to go before the round £1 stops being accepted in shops and restaurants, BBC Children in Need is encouraging everyone to check their piggy banks, empty coat pockets and dive down the back of sofas to dig out any lurking round pound coins.</p>

<p>A new poll* suggests that six in ten of us would like to donate our remaining round pounds to charities, like BBC Children in Need. With one in three people still having these coins stashed away in savings jars and piggy banks, the message is clear – dig them out, head over to your local drop-off point and donate them to BBC Children in Need’s 2017 Appeal!</p>

<p>Commercial Director of BBC Children in Need, Jonathan Rigby, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">We are really excited to work with The Royal Mint and HM Treasury for Pudsey’s Round Pound Countdown and hope that as many people as possible will get involved in this nationwide treasure hunt and put their old round pounds to good use. Every round pound donated will go on to make a real difference to the lives of disadvantaged children and young people across the UK.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CEO and Deputy Master of The Royal Mint, Adam Lawrence, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">Any round £1 coins donated to BBC Children in Need through Pudsey’s Round Pound Countdown will not only go to a fantastic cause but they will make their way back to The Royal Mint where some will be melted to make new £1 coins.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, Andrew Jones MP, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">Over the last few months, we have urged the public to spend, bank or donate their round pounds ahead of the October 15 deadline. We are delighted to partner with BBC Children in Need, and are encouraging everyone who can, to promise their round pounds to Pudsey.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>BBC Children in Need’s vision is that every child in the UK has a childhood that is safe, happy and allows them the chance to reach their potential. The charity is currently supporting over 2,400 projects in communities across the UK that are helping children and young people facing a range of disadvantages such as living in poverty, being disabled or ill, or experiencing distress, neglect or trauma.</p>

<h3 id=""notes-to-editors"">Notes to editors</h3>

<p>There are thousands of BBC Children in Need drop-off points across the country where you can handover your donations. For more information on where to find them, visit <a rel=""external"" href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/corporate2/childreninneed"">www.bbc.co.uk/Pudsey</a>.</p>

<p>*Figures are from YouGov Plc. Total sample size was 2,004 adults. Fieldwork was undertaken across September 2017. The survey was carried out online. The figures have been weighted and are representative of UK adults (aged 18+).</p>

      <div class=""govspeak"">
<p>Animal abusers who commit the most heinous crimes could face up to five years in prison under new plans set to be unveiled by Environment Secretary Michael Gove.</p>

<p>Currently the maximum sentence is six months but the government will announce plans to bring forward new legislation that will increase that tenfold, sending a clear signal to any potential offenders that there is no place for animal cruelty in England.</p>

<p>There have been a number of recent shocking cases where courts have said they would have handed down longer sentences had they been available, including a case in April last year when a man bought a number of puppies just to brutally and systematically beat, choke and stab them to death. The new legislation will also enable courts to deal more effectively with ruthless gangs involved in organised dog fights.</p>

<p>Environment Secretary Michael Gove said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are a nation of animal lovers and so we must ensure that those who commit the most shocking cruelty towards animals face suitably tough punishments.</p>

  <p>These plans will give courts the tools they have requested to deal with the most abhorrent acts.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">This is one part of our plan to deliver world-leading standards of animal welfare in the years ahead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cases of extreme cruelty are rare – while on average about 1,150 people per year are convicted for animal cruelty, fewer than five of them receive the current maximum sentence. The change in law will ensure that offenders are properly punished in those rare but shocking cases.</p>

<p>Under the government’s plans, courts will retain the ability to hand out an unlimited fine and ban an offender from owning animals in the future, but crucially they will also have the ability to sentence the worst cases appropriately. 
The move will bring maximum sentences for animal cruelty in England into line with other countries such as Australia, Canada, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>Some of the recent shocking cases in which courts commented they would have handed down longer prison sentences had the law allowed them include:</p>

<ul>
<li>A man who systematically abused and killed several puppies by beating, choking and stabbing them, sentenced to the maximum six months’ imprisonment and banned from owning animals.</li>
  <li>A man who kicked his girlfriend’s dog to death, given a custodial sentence of just over five months, fined £1,000 and banned from owning animals.</li>
  <li>A man who fed his dog aspirin and paracetamol to try to kill her, before beating her to death with a shovel, sentenced to four months in prison and banned from owning animals.</li>
</ul>
<p>The move was widely welcomed by animal welfare groups and follows dedicated campaigning from Battersea Dogs &amp; Cats Home and the RSPCA.</p>

<p>Claire Horton, Chief Executive of Battersea Dogs &amp; Cats Home, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Battersea is thrilled that the Government plans to raise the maximum sentence for the most abhorrent cases of animal cruelty in England from six months to five years.</p>

  <p>This shows that the political will is there to make the punishment fit the crime and so many innocent animals will benefit from their actions.</p>

  <p>This news will be very positively received by the public, the majority of whom share Battersea’s  wish to see this change. Since we launched our campaign calling for five year sentences at Westminster in February, the momentum has clearly been building and the response has been tremendous, with close to 62,000 members of the public across the UK calling on their elected representatives to back this change – and 145 politicians already have.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">Battersea stands ready to help in any way we can to support this move to five year sentences and make such shocking cruelty to animals a thing of the past.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>RSPCA Head of Public Affairs David Bowles said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are thrilled that the Government has responded to calls from the RSPCA and members of the public to toughen up sentences for the worst animal abusers. We now feel that those who commit these acts will soon be receiving sentences that reflect the seriousness of their crime and hope this will act as a real deterrent against cruelty and neglect.</p>

  <p>The RSPCA picks up the pieces of animal cruelty every day of the year. Our inspectors regularly rescue animals from horrific circumstances of mistreatment, brutality and neglect. It is only through the prosecutions that we take that many of the perpetrators are brought to justice.</p>

  <p>The strength of feeling behind a move to toughen up these sentences is huge - but at the moment the courts are limited by the law under which the strongest sentence for animal cruelty is six months’ imprisonment and an unlimited fine - but this rarely happens.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">Michael Gove’s promise to bring sentences in line with Northern Ireland - which has a maximum of five years imprisonment - should help to deter people from abusing and neglecting animals and will finally mean that the sentence fits the crime.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The government will publish draft legislation for consultation around the turn of the year.</p>

<p>These plans are part of an ambitious programme of reform that will cement the UK’s position as a global leader on animal welfare as we leave the EU. Last month we announced plans to make CCTV mandatory in all slaughterhouses and we have committed to taking steps to control the export of live farm animals for slaughter as we leave the EU.</p>

Press release
Sentences for animal cruelty to increase tenfold to five years
Environment Secretary Michael Gove has announced that animal abusers could face up to five years in prison
Published 30 September 2017
From:
Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, Animal and Plant Health Agency, Lord Gardiner of Kimble, and The Rt Hon Michael Gove MP
Animal abusers who commit the most heinous crimes could face up to five years in prison under new plans set to be unveiled by Environment Secretary Michael Gove.
Currently the maximum sentence is six months but the government will announce plans to bring forward new legislation that will increase that tenfold, sending a clear signal to any potential offenders that there is no place for animal cruelty in England.
There have been a number of recent shocking cases where courts have said they would have handed down longer sentences had they been available, including a case in April last year when a man bought a number of puppies just to brutally and systematically beat, choke and stab them to death. The new legislation will also enable courts to deal more effectively with ruthless gangs involved in organised dog fights.
Environment Secretary Michael Gove said:
We are a nation of animal lovers and so we must ensure that those who commit the most shocking cruelty towards animals face suitably tough punishments.
These plans will give courts the tools they have requested to deal with the most abhorrent acts.
This is one part of our plan to deliver world-leading standards of animal welfare in the years ahead.
Cases of extreme cruelty are rare – while on average about 1,150 people per year are convicted for animal cruelty, fewer than five of them receive the current maximum sentence. The change in law will ensure that offenders are properly punished in those rare but shocking cases.
Under the government’s plans, courts will retain the ability to hand out an unlimited fine and ban an offender from owning animals in the future, but crucially they will also have the ability to sentence the worst cases appropriately. 
The move will bring maximum sentences for animal cruelty in England into line with other countries such as Australia, Canada, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Some of the recent shocking cases in which courts commented they would have handed down longer prison sentences had the law allowed them include:
A man who systematically abused and killed several puppies by beating, choking and stabbing them, sentenced to the maximum six months’ imprisonment and banned from owning animals.
A man who kicked his girlfriend’s dog to death, given a custodial sentence of just over five months, fined £1,000 and banned from owning animals.
A man who fed his dog aspirin and paracetamol to try to kill her, before beating her to death with a shovel, sentenced to four months in prison and banned from owning animals.
The move was widely welcomed by animal welfare groups and follows dedicated campaigning from Battersea Dogs & Cats Home and the RSPCA.
Claire Horton, Chief Executive of Battersea Dogs & Cats Home, said:
Battersea is thrilled that the Government plans to raise the maximum sentence for the most abhorrent cases of animal cruelty in England from six months to five years.
This shows that the political will is there to make the punishment fit the crime and so many innocent animals will benefit from their actions.
This news will be very positively received by the public, the majority of whom share Battersea’s  wish to see this change. Since we launched our campaign calling for five year sentences at Westminster in February, the momentum has clearly been building and the response has been tremendous, with close to 62,000 members of the public across the UK calling on their elected representatives to back this change – and 145 politicians already have.
Battersea stands ready to help in any way we can to support this move to five year sentences and make such shocking cruelty to animals a thing of the past.
RSPCA Head of Public Affairs David Bowles said:
We are thrilled that the Government has responded to calls from the RSPCA and members of the public to toughen up sentences for the worst animal abusers. We now feel that those who commit these acts will soon be receiving sentences that reflect the seriousness of their crime and hope this will act as a real deterrent against cruelty and neglect.
The RSPCA picks up the pieces of animal cruelty every day of the year. Our inspectors regularly rescue animals from horrific circumstances of mistreatment, brutality and neglect. It is only through the prosecutions that we take that many of the perpetrators are brought to justice.
The strength of feeling behind a move to toughen up these sentences is huge - but at the moment the courts are limited by the law under which the strongest sentence for animal cruelty is six months’ imprisonment and an unlimited fine - but this rarely happens.
Michael Gove’s promise to bring sentences in line with Northern Ireland - which has a maximum of five years imprisonment - should help to deter people from abusing and neglecting animals and will finally mean that the sentence fits the crime.
The government will publish draft legislation for consultation around the turn of the year.
These plans are part of an ambitious programme of reform that will cement the UK’s position as a global leader on animal welfare as we leave the EU. Last month we announced plans to make CCTV mandatory in all slaughterhouses and we have committed to taking steps to control the export of live farm animals for slaughter as we leave the EU.

<p>The government is today publishing the Clean Growth Strategy - an ambitious strategy to cut emissions while keeping costs down for consumers, creating good jobs and growing the economy. This is an important component of our modern Industrial Strategy. We are also laying our responses to the Committee on Climate Change’s 2017 Progress Report to Parliament and publishing a suite of related documents.</p>

<p>Clean growth can make a real difference to people’s lives, from reducing energy bills and improving air quality, to supporting new technologies and boosting earning power in high-quality jobs.</p>

<p>We start from a position of strength. We have already made significant progress towards our legally binding 2050 target to reduce emissions by at least 80 per cent against 1990 levels. We exceeded the target emissions reductions of our first carbon budget (2008 to 2012) by one per cent of the budget level and we project that we will outperform against our second and third budgets covering the years 2013 to 2022 by almost five per cent and four per cent respectively.</p>

<p>The UK is a world leader in cutting emissions while growing the economy. Provisional statistics indicate that UK emissions in 2016 were 42 per cent lower than in 1990 and 6 per cent below those in 2015. At the same time, the UK’s GDP has increased by 67 per cent since 1990 showing that a strong, growing economy can go hand in hand with reduced emissions. On a per person basis, this means that we have reduced emissions faster than any other G7 nation and led the G7 group in growth in national income over the period.</p>

<p>The global transition to a low carbon economy offers huge growth opportunities which the UK is well placed to take advantage of as a core element of our Industrial Strategy. Our low carbon sector already employs over 230,000 people directly and another 200,000 through supply chains. Analysis for the Committee on Climate Change estimated that the low carbon economy has the potential to grow 11 per cent per year between 2015 and 2030 - four times faster than the rest of the economy.</p>

<p>While we have performed strongly to date, the task ahead is significant. The Clean Growth Strategy sets out policies and proposals across the whole of the economy and the country including business, housing, transport, power, the natural environment and the public sector.</p>

<p>Low carbon innovation is at the heart of our approach, with over £2.5 billion of government investment from 2015 to 2021. This forms part of the largest increase in public spending on UK science, research and innovation in almost 40 years.</p>

<p>The Clean Growth Strategy is an important milestone in the UK’s work to cut emissions and grow the economy. But it is not the end of the process. Clean technology is developing at a rapid pace and costs are falling faster than many predicted - for example, the cost of offshore wind has halved in two years. We look forward to working with colleagues across both Houses and the Devolved Administrations, and with people and organisations across the country, to ensure the UK can continue to lead the world in clean growth.</p>

<p>Shane Zeb Khattak has been disqualified from acting as a director for 10 years, following an investigation by the Insolvency Service.  The Secretary of State for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy accepted a disqualification undertaking from Khattak which commenced on 2 October 2017.</p>

<p>Khattak was acting as a director for Recruitment Base (UK) Limited which provided payroll and recruitment services in the Midlands. He failed to ensure that Recruitment Base complied with obligations around immigration checks, resulting in the employment of 11 illegal workers.</p>

<p>Additionally, from 13 March 2015 until its liquidation he was acting as a director whilst being undischarged bankrupt, without leave of the Court.</p>

<p>On four separate occasions between 30 April 2014 and 8 June 2015, Home Office Immigration Officers investigated businesses in the Midlands, finding illegal workers that were employed by Recruitment Base. The Home Office fined Recruitment Base a total of £140,000, none of which was paid.</p>

<p>Khattak claimed that a fire at the trading premises had destroyed employee records, resulting in an inability to provide documentation on the workers. However, the claimed date of the fire was before the start of employment of 10 of the men found to be working illegally, and the other breach pre-dated the fire by seven months, during which no documents had been provided.</p>

<p>On 15 September 2014, The Law Society petitioned for Khattak’s bankruptcy.  A bankruptcy order was made against him on 13 March 2015 in the Birmingham County Court.</p>

<p>Commenting on the disqualification, Cheryl Lambert, Chief Investigator at the Insolvency Service, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">In this case, Shane Khattak displayed a thoroughly disreputable contempt for his obligation to comply with the law, being willing to provide inaccurate statements to a series of authorities to cover up his activities.</p>

Press release
Bankrupt director banned for supplying illegal workers
The bankrupt owner of a recruitment company that supplied illegal workers in the Midlands has been banned for 10 years
Published 20 October 2017
From:
The Insolvency Service
Shane Zeb Khattak has been disqualified from acting as a director for 10 years, following an investigation by the Insolvency Service.  The Secretary of State for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy accepted a disqualification undertaking from Khattak which commenced on 2 October 2017.
Khattak was acting as a director for Recruitment Base (UK) Limited which provided payroll and recruitment services in the Midlands. He failed to ensure that Recruitment Base complied with obligations around immigration checks, resulting in the employment of 11 illegal workers.
Additionally, from 13 March 2015 until its liquidation he was acting as a director whilst being undischarged bankrupt, without leave of the Court.
On four separate occasions between 30 April 2014 and 8 June 2015, Home Office Immigration Officers investigated businesses in the Midlands, finding illegal workers that were employed by Recruitment Base. The Home Office fined Recruitment Base a total of £140,000, none of which was paid.
Khattak claimed that a fire at the trading premises had destroyed employee records, resulting in an inability to provide documentation on the workers. However, the claimed date of the fire was before the start of employment of 10 of the men found to be working illegally, and the other breach pre-dated the fire by seven months, during which no documents had been provided.
On 15 September 2014, The Law Society petitioned for Khattak’s bankruptcy.  A bankruptcy order was made against him on 13 March 2015 in the Birmingham County Court.
Commenting on the disqualification, Cheryl Lambert, Chief Investigator at the Insolvency Service, said:
In this case, Shane Khattak displayed a thoroughly disreputable contempt for his obligation to comply with the law, being willing to provide inaccurate statements to a series of authorities to cover up his activities.
In partnership with the Home Office, who remove people who have no right to work from the market place; the Insolvency Service is seeking to ensure those who exploit the vulnerable will also be dealt with. They will be removed from the bank of legitimate directors.
A Home Office spokesperson said:
Illegal working is not victimless. It undercuts honest employers, cheats legitimate job seekers out of employment opportunities and defrauds the taxpayer.
Businesses should be aware that they have a duty to check that their staff have permission to work in the UK.
We are happy to work with employers who play by the rules but those who do not, should know that they will not go under our radar.

<p>In January 2017, MHRA launched a <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/strategy-for-pharmacopoeial-public-quality-standards-for-biological-medicines"">public consultation on pharmacopoeial quality standards for biological medicines</a>.</p>

<p>The quality of biological medicines, which are an increasingly important part of healthcare worldwide, is assured by a regulatory framework which includes compliance to public quality standards. Documentary and physical standards work together to make sure biological medicines are of acceptable quality for use by patients.</p>

<p>The consultation posed specific questions to understand stakeholders’ perspectives on biological medicines, how biological quality standards should be developed, what they should look like and how they can enable innovation, and how the Agency can best engage with users. The consultation was received positively by stakeholders and a wide range of responses were received representing trade associations, manufacturers, academia/researchers and peer organisations.</p>

<p>The responses were analysed by a cross-Agency group, and the key themes of value and innovation, Agency role, alternative approaches and unmet needs, collaboration and international engagement were drawn out:</p>

<ul>
<li>Value and innovation: in general, responses supported the value of standardisation as an important activity in ensuring the quality of medicines</li>
  <li>Agency role: the Agency, through its unique incorporation of the regulatory and standard setting functions (BP and NIBSC), is well placed to make an important contribution to the development of biological standards.</li>
  <li>Alternative approaches and unmet needs: alternative approaches and unmet needs identified by stakeholders were focussed on standards for biotechnologically produced proteins, raw materials and ATMPs.</li>
  <li>Collaboration: the opportunity to engage with the Agency on the draft strategy was commended and there was a clear desire for the Agency to continue to do this going forward, including offers of collaboration</li>
  <li>International engagement: consistent throughout the responses was the need for MHRA to engage with, and influence, the international regulatory and standard setting environment</li>
</ul>
<p>The response document <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/strategy-for-pharmacopoeial-public-quality-standards-for-biological-medicines"">published today</a> sets out how the Agency plans to incorporate the feedback we received from stakeholders into its strategy and the resultant work programme.</p>

<p>The work programme relates to key activities we are committed to undertaking to implement our strategy for pharmacopoeial standards for biological medicines. The activities fall into 3 broad categories: standards development; engaging with users and building knowledge; our international peers. Key points are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Establishing three working parties with representatives from MHRA regulatory, British Pharmacopoeia, NIBSC and experts from industry and academia to explore alternative approaches, ATMPs and Raw materials</li>
  <li>A number of activities to continually engage stakeholders in the work including a 2018 symposium
 Maintaining our active roles and relationships internationally</li>
</ul>
<p>We would like to thank all those who shared their views with us. If you have any further questions on the consultation response, please contact us on <a href=""mailto:BiolStandards@mhra.gov.uk"">BiolStandards@mhra.gov.uk</a>.</p>

Pharmacopoeial biological standards assure the quality of biological medicines
MHRA is releasing the response to January’s consultation on the strategy for pharmacopoeial public quality standards for biological medicines
Published 23 October 2017
From:
Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency
In January 2017, MHRA launched a public consultation on pharmacopoeial quality standards for biological medicines.
The quality of biological medicines, which are an increasingly important part of healthcare worldwide, is assured by a regulatory framework which includes compliance to public quality standards. Documentary and physical standards work together to make sure biological medicines are of acceptable quality for use by patients.
The consultation posed specific questions to understand stakeholders’ perspectives on biological medicines, how biological quality standards should be developed, what they should look like and how they can enable innovation, and how the Agency can best engage with users. The consultation was received positively by stakeholders and a wide range of responses were received representing trade associations, manufacturers, academia/researchers and peer organisations.
The responses were analysed by a cross-Agency group, and the key themes of value and innovation, Agency role, alternative approaches and unmet needs, collaboration and international engagement were drawn out:
Value and innovation: in general, responses supported the value of standardisation as an important activity in ensuring the quality of medicines
Agency role: the Agency, through its unique incorporation of the regulatory and standard setting functions (BP and NIBSC), is well placed to make an important contribution to the development of biological standards.
Alternative approaches and unmet needs: alternative approaches and unmet needs identified by stakeholders were focussed on standards for biotechnologically produced proteins, raw materials and ATMPs.
Collaboration: the opportunity to engage with the Agency on the draft strategy was commended and there was a clear desire for the Agency to continue to do this going forward, including offers of collaboration
International engagement: consistent throughout the responses was the need for MHRA to engage with, and influence, the international regulatory and standard setting environment
The response document published today sets out how the Agency plans to incorporate the feedback we received from stakeholders into its strategy and the resultant work programme.
The work programme relates to key activities we are committed to undertaking to implement our strategy for pharmacopoeial standards for biological medicines. The activities fall into 3 broad categories: standards development; engaging with users and building knowledge; our international peers. Key points are:
Establishing three working parties with representatives from MHRA regulatory, British Pharmacopoeia, NIBSC and experts from industry and academia to explore alternative approaches, ATMPs and Raw materials
A number of activities to continually engage stakeholders in the work including a 2018 symposium
Maintaining our active roles and relationships internationally
We would like to thank all those who shared their views with us. If you have any further questions on the consultation response, please contact us on BiolStandards@mhra.gov.uk.

<p>The Environment Agency is reminding anglers of the importance of having a rod licence, after a Nottingham man was ordered to pay a fine of £346 plus costs after being found guilty of fishing without a licence.
Wayne Dickens of The Square, Bestwood Village was fined by the court to a total penalty of £1,393 after being found in breach of the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act (1975) in June 2017.</p>

<p>The case heard at Wellingborough Magistrates Court on 9 November 2017 was brought by the Environment Agency following the discovery of the offender in Strawberry Fields, Lincoln in June 2017.</p>

<p>Following the verdict, Steve Powell, Enforcement Team Manager for the Environment Agency said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s important that all anglers understand how seriously the courts take these offences and we hope it will provide as a deterrent for any angler thinking of fishing without a licence. All the money raised from rod licence sales is used to protect and improve fish stocks and fisheries, benefitting anglers and those cheating the system will be prosecuted.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">Every year across the country, thousands of anglers are prosecuted for not having a fishing licence. As well as swindling other anglers, fishing illegally can carry a hefty penalty. Getting caught without a licence could land you with a fine of up to £2,500.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Any angler aged 12 or over, fishing on a river, canal or still water needs a licence. An annual licence costs from just £30 (concessions available) and is available from <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/fishing-licences"">GOV.UK</a> or by calling the Environment Agency on 0344 800 5386 between 8am and 6pm, Monday to Friday.</p>

<p>Anyone with information about illegal fishing activities can contact the Environment Agency Incident Hotline on 0800 80 70 60 or anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>

Press release
Nottingham man faces hefty fine for fishing without a licence
Bestwood man caught fishing without a licence in Lincoln
Published 14 November 2017
From:
Environment Agency
The Environment Agency is reminding anglers of the importance of having a rod licence, after a Nottingham man was ordered to pay a fine of £346 plus costs after being found guilty of fishing without a licence.
Wayne Dickens of The Square, Bestwood Village was fined by the court to a total penalty of £1,393 after being found in breach of the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act (1975) in June 2017.
The case heard at Wellingborough Magistrates Court on 9 November 2017 was brought by the Environment Agency following the discovery of the offender in Strawberry Fields, Lincoln in June 2017.
Following the verdict, Steve Powell, Enforcement Team Manager for the Environment Agency said:
It’s important that all anglers understand how seriously the courts take these offences and we hope it will provide as a deterrent for any angler thinking of fishing without a licence. All the money raised from rod licence sales is used to protect and improve fish stocks and fisheries, benefitting anglers and those cheating the system will be prosecuted.
Every year across the country, thousands of anglers are prosecuted for not having a fishing licence. As well as swindling other anglers, fishing illegally can carry a hefty penalty. Getting caught without a licence could land you with a fine of up to £2,500.
Any angler aged 12 or over, fishing on a river, canal or still water needs a licence. An annual licence costs from just £30 (concessions available) and is available from GOV.UK or by calling the Environment Agency on 0344 800 5386 between 8am and 6pm, Monday to Friday.
Anyone with information about illegal fishing activities can contact the Environment Agency Incident Hotline on 0800 80 70 60 or anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

<p>Mr Bolt said:</p>

<p>“The Home Office devotes significant resources to managing asylum claims. Nonetheless, it continues to struggle to keep on top of the volumes of claims it receives. In 2016-17, despite the evident commitment and hard work of those involved, high staff turnover, prolonged staffing gaps and inexperience caused problems that were not easily or quickly fixed.</p>

<p>“As a consequence, the number of claims awaiting an initial decision rose during the year, as did the proportion deemed ‘non-straightforward’ and therefore set outside the published service standard of 6 months for a decision.

<p>“The Home Office has described the asylum system as “in transition”. I am aware of its plans to transform and enable it to cope better with peaks in demand. However, these plans were not sufficiently advanced at the time of this inspection for their effectiveness to be tested.</p>

<p>“My message to the Home Office is that it needs to accelerate its transformation plans and to ensure it has asylum processing and decision making under control as soon as possible. Otherwise, the next peak in asylum intake, or trough in staffing levels, will see it fall further behind.</p>

<p>“This inspection makes 7 recommendations for improvement. The Home Office has accepted 6 in full and 1 in part. I look forward to revisiting this important area of the Home Office’s work in due course and checking on the progress made.</p>

<p>“In the meantime, for the sake of clarity, while the Home Office response is correct in saying that I found no evidence that asylum policy and processes are gender biased, this was because the data was insufficiently detailed to permit meaningful analysis. This is not a positive finding - data collection needs to improve if the Home Office is to persuade stakeholders that their concerns are unfounded.”</p>

<p>The completed report was sent to the Home Secretary on 25 September 2017.</p>

The Chief Inspector's report on the Home Office's asylum intake and casework has been published
The Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, David Bolt, makes 7 recommendations in his report on the Home Office’s asylum intake and casework process.
Published 28 November 2017
From:
Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration 
Mr Bolt said:
“The Home Office devotes significant resources to managing asylum claims. Nonetheless, it continues to struggle to keep on top of the volumes of claims it receives. In 2016-17, despite the evident commitment and hard work of those involved, high staff turnover, prolonged staffing gaps and inexperience caused problems that were not easily or quickly fixed.
“As a consequence, the number of claims awaiting an initial decision rose during the year, as did the proportion deemed ‘non-straightforward’ and therefore set outside the published service standard of 6 months for a decision. The inspection also found issues with decision quality. Given the life-changing nature of asylum decisions, the Home Office’s performance needs to improve.
“The Home Office has described the asylum system as “in transition”. I am aware of its plans to transform and enable it to cope better with peaks in demand. However, these plans were not sufficiently advanced at the time of this inspection for their effectiveness to be tested.
“My message to the Home Office is that it needs to accelerate its transformation plans and to ensure it has asylum processing and decision making under control as soon as possible. Otherwise, the next peak in asylum intake, or trough in staffing levels, will see it fall further behind.
“This inspection makes 7 recommendations for improvement. The Home Office has accepted 6 in full and 1 in part. I look forward to revisiting this important area of the Home Office’s work in due course and checking on the progress made.
“In the meantime, for the sake of clarity, while the Home Office response is correct in saying that I found no evidence that asylum policy and processes are gender biased, this was because the data was insufficiently detailed to permit meaningful analysis. This is not a positive finding - data collection needs to improve if the Home Office is to persuade stakeholders that their concerns are unfounded.”
The completed report was sent to the Home Secretary on 25 September 2017.

<p>Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Karen Bradley said:</p>

<p>Northern Powerhouse Minister, Jake Berry, said:</p>

<p>“The Northern Cultural Regeneration Fund will help communities show the world how the great art and culture, design and ingenuity of the North shapes all our lives. It also gives regions the chance to bid for funding for projects which deliver transformative change for local residents while firmly placing the North at the forefront of arts and culture in the UK.”</p>

<p>The first round of bids have been coordinated by Local Enterprise Partnerships in Cheshire and Warrington, Cumbria, Greater Manchester, Humber, Lancashire, Leeds City Region, Liverpool City Region, North East, Sheffield City Region, Tees Valley, York and North Yorkshire and East Riding.</p>

Held in Newcastle and Gateshead next summer, the free family-friendly exhibition will showcase the best of Northern art, design and innovation and is set to be the biggest event in 2018.</p>

<p>The immersive exhibition - supported by £5 million of government funding - will engage communities and businesses from across the region, and promote the bustling and thriving area to the world.</p>

<p>Successful bids to the Northern Cultural Regeneration Fund will encourage sustainable cultural and creative regeneration in the North of England and benefit areas that have historically had low levels of cultural and creative investment.

<blockquote>
  <p>Wishing all in the Jewish community in the UK and around the world a Happy Chanukkah as this festival of light and liberty starts tonight!</p>

  <p>This Jewish festival of Chanukkah is a celebration of the triumph of the Maccabees over religious persecution. The lighting of the Menorah is a reminder that even in the darkest of times we can work together we can build a brighter future.</p>

  <p>It must spur us to rededicate ourselves to the task of building a world where freedom is a guaranteed for all, where we work for peace and security and where we fight against prejudice.</p>

  <p>The British and Jewish people are not only connected through shared history and values, the Jewish community has contributed to every part of British life- its success shows Britain at its best; tolerant, open and welcoming to all those who want to work hard and get on in life.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">As friends and family prepare to come together to celebrate the Jewish festival of lights, I send my warmest wishes for a very happy and peaceful Chanukkah to the Jewish community in the UK and around the world.
Chanukkah Sameach!</p>

Foreign Secretary's Chanukkah message
Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson sends his warmest wishes for the Festival of Lights
Published 12 December 2017
From:
Foreign & Commonwealth Office and The Rt Hon Boris  Johnson MP
Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said:
Wishing all in the Jewish community in the UK and around the world a Happy Chanukkah as this festival of light and liberty starts tonight!
This Jewish festival of Chanukkah is a celebration of the triumph of the Maccabees over religious persecution. The lighting of the Menorah is a reminder that even in the darkest of times we can work together we can build a brighter future.
It must spur us to rededicate ourselves to the task of building a world where freedom is a guaranteed for all, where we work for peace and security and where we fight against prejudice.
The British and Jewish people are not only connected through shared history and values, the Jewish community has contributed to every part of British life- its success shows Britain at its best; tolerant, open and welcoming to all those who want to work hard and get on in life.
As friends and family prepare to come together to celebrate the Jewish festival of lights, I send my warmest wishes for a very happy and peaceful Chanukkah to the Jewish community in the UK and around the world.
Chanukkah Sameach!

<p>Bovine TB will be caught and stamped out more quickly in England’s cattle herds under plans to strengthen testing in the highest-risk areas of the country.</p>

<p>Six monthly routine tests will be introduced for all herds in the High Risk Area – mainly the South West and parts of the Midlands – with annual tests preserved for herds that have gone five or more years without disease, and farms accredited under the <a rel=""external"" href=""http://www.checs.co.uk/"">Cattle Herd Certification Standards (CHeCS) scheme</a>, requiring tougher biosecurity measures to be observed.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/badger-edge-vaccination-scheme-2-bevs-2"">Grants</a> to vaccinate badgers in the Edge Area of the country – the ‘buffer’ between the High Risk and Low Risk Areas – are also available now for schemes to run next year.</p>

<p>These moves are part of the government’s comprehensive 25-year plan to eradicate bovine TB in England and come as <a rel=""external"" href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.3254/full"">recent peer-reviewed research</a> shows badger control in Gloucestershire (58%) and Somerset (21%) – where culling began in 2013 – has contributed to significant reductions in the disease in herds.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bovine-tb-summary-of-badger-control-monitoring-during-2017"">Results</a> published today also confirm that all 19 licensed intensive badger control operations achieved the badger population reductions needed to realise disease control benefits.</p>

<p>Farming Minister George Eustice said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">Our comprehensive strategy to eradicate bovine TB is delivering results. We are introducing more frequent testing of cattle to find and stamp out disease more quickly than ever before, to add to our tough restrictions on cattle movements to stop disease spreading. We are also addressing the disease in wildlife and it is encouraging to see early research shows badger control is having the expected results in driving down levels of TB.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chief Veterinary Officer Nigel Gibbens said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">This year’s results show that badger control can be delivered successfully on a much wider scale, with all 11 new areas delivering effective operations. Expansion into further areas, alongside our robust cattle movement and testing regime, will allow us to achieve and maintain long term reductions in the level of TB across the South West and Midlands where the disease is widespread.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the Edge Area of the country, testing frequency will become more risk-based from January 2018, with more herds undertaking six-monthly testing. This will help vets identify and address outbreaks more quickly, helping to stop the spread of disease to new areas.</p>

<p>The government is offering grants under the Badger Edge Vaccination Scheme, which recommences in 2018 and aims to create a buffer zone between the highest- and lowest-risk disease areas of England. The scheme is open for the first round of applications until 19 January and successful applicants will receive a government grant for at least 50% of their costs from a fund worth £700,000 over four years.</p>

<p>Dealing with Bovine TB in England costs taxpayers over £100 million a year, required the culling of more than 29,000 cattle in 2016 and causes devastation and distress for rural communities.</p>

<p>Other measures announced today as part of the government’s 25-year strategy to eradicate bovine TB are:</p>

<ul>
<li>
    <p>New compensation arrangements for pigs, sheep, goats, deer and camelids which have to be slaughtered because of bovine TB. The changes will come into force on 2 January 2018 and will bring statutory compensation in line with arrangements in Scotland and Wales.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reduced compensation for animals which are unclean when presented for slaughter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Delayed slaughter of pregnant cattle which test positive for bTB.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Farmers can also access practical guidance on the TB Hub website, which brings advice from farming experts, vets and government together in one place.</p>

More frequent cattle testing to boost fight against bovine TB
Grants for badger vaccination schemes and six-monthly testing in high risk areas will help to prevent disease and catch it more quickly.

MMO board member Tony Delahunty awarded OBE
Tony Delahunty has been made Officer of the Order of the British Empire for his services to the fishing industry in the New Year’s honours list.
Published 31 December 2017
From:
Marine Management Organisation
Her Majesty The Queen has made Marine Management Organisation (MMO) non-executive board member Tony Delahunty Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the New Year’s honour list 2018 for his services to the fishing industry.
OBEs are awarded for having played ‘a major local role in any activity, including people whose work has made them known nationally in their chosen area’.
Tony is a fisherman and businessman with over 40 years’ experience of working in the inshore fishing industry. He has represented and championed fisheries management issues locally, nationally and internationally throughout his career driven by a lifelong commitment to the sustainable management of our seas.
As well as being an MMO board member he has had roles in both the public and private sectors including his appointment as National Chair of the National Federation of Fisherman; Chair of the Sussex Inshore Fisheries Conservation Authority and Vice Chair of Sussex Sea Fisheries Committee.
Tony has also been a member of Selsey Lifeboat since 1978 serving as a crew member, senior helmsman and deputy coxswain and currently serves as deputy launch authority.
On receiving his OBE, Tony said:
“I have worked as an inshore fisherman for most of life and have had the opportunity to contribute to fisheries management issues, locally and nationally and I am honoured to receive this award. Whilst I am personally very pleased, I feel that it also recognises the importance and value of the work done by the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisation (NFFO), DEFRA and the Marine Management Organisation.”

<p>Changes to evidence requirements in private family law disputes have come into effect. There will no longer be a time limit on abuse evidence, which previously stood at five years.</p>

<p>Additionally, the range of documents accepted as evidence of abuse has been widened to include statements from domestic violence support organisations and housing support officers.</p>

<p>Justice Minister Dominic Raab said:</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">Today’s changes will ensure that vulnerable women and children get legal support, so their voice is properly heard in court.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Legal aid is available to people involved in private family disputes if they are victims, or are at risk of becoming victims, of domestic violence or child abuse. To qualify, applicants must provide objective evidence of the abuse while their case is also subject to means and merits tests.</p>

<p>Today’s changes follow a review of the evidence requirements set out in the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act (LASPO) 2012.</p>

<p>The changes are the latest in a series of reforms the government is making to support victims of domestic violence, having previously announced a £17 million fund to support 41 projects across the country to tackle violence against women and girls.</p>

<p>The landmark Domestic Violence and Abuse Bill will also ensure that no stone is left unturned in protecting and supporting domestic violence victims and children.</p>

Press release
Minister for Europe's statement on human rights in Russia following the arrest of Oyub Titiev
English
Русский
Minister Sir Alan Duncan calls on the Chechen authorities to ensure the safety and the right to a fair trial of human rights activist Oyub Titiev.
Published 18 January 2018
From:
Foreign & Commonwealth Office and The Rt Hon Sir Alan Duncan KCMG MP
On 9 January prominent human rights activist Oyub Titiev, the Director of Russian non-governmental organisation (NGO) Memorial’s office in Chechnya, was detained by the Chechen authorities. He was subsequently charged with the illegal acquisition and storage of narcotics.
Although significant doubts have been raised about the legitimacy of these allegations, a local court has remanded him in custody until 9 March. Overnight on 16 January Memorial’s office in Ingushetia – a neighbouring republic in the North Caucasus – was destroyed by an arson attack.
Sir Alan Duncan said:
The decision of the Chechen authorities to charge Oyub Titiev, the Director of Russian human rights NGO Memorial’s office in Chechnya, and remand him in custody until 9 March, is extremely concerning. Since his arrest, Mr Titiev’s family has also faced harassment and threats which have forced them to flee the region. This is yet another example of the restrictions on freedom within Russia which I raised in Moscow in December.
I was appalled to also hear that Memorial’s office in the neighbouring republic of Ingushetia has been destroyed by an arson attack overnight. This is clearly another attempt to disrupt and intimidate Memorial and other NGOs working on crucial human rights issues in the North Caucasus region of Russia. The Russian government must urgently investigate this attack and hold those responsible to account.
The Chechen authorities must ensure the safety of Mr Titiev and allow him the right to a fair trial, and immediately cease the intimidation, harassment and detention of individuals and groups advocating such fundamental freedoms.

<ul>
<li>countries committed to working more closely on research and innovation across sectors including artificial intelligence, space and climate change</li>
  <li>Energy Minister Richard Harrington also signed agreement for the 2 countries to work more closely on civil nuclear decommissioning</li>
</ul>
<p>Business and Energy Secretary Greg Clark met with French ministers Brune Poirson, Secretary of State for the Ecological and Solidarity-based Transition, and Delphine Gény-Stephann, Secretary of State for Economy and Finance, during the UK-France Summit to promote the UK’s ambitious <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/the-uks-industrial-strategy"">Industrial Strategy</a>. He underlined how closer collaboration between the 2 countries will lead to better research outcomes, using our shared distinctive strengths to meet the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/industrial-strategy-the-grand-challenges/industrial-strategy-the-grand-challenges"">Grand Challenges</a> set out in the government’s Industrial Strategy.</p>

<p>Innovation is at the heart of the government’s Industrial Strategy, and the Business and Energy Secretary highlighted the importance of sharing knowledge and resources in order to meet the shared economic and environmental challenges facing the 2 countries.</p>

<p>After the meeting, Business and Energy Secretary Greg Clark said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Innovation and collaboration with our international partners are at the heart of our modern Industrial Strategy. If we are to seize the opportunities and meet the challenges of the future, we need to work closely with countries that share our ambition.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">France is the UK’s third largest trading partner and we want to take advantage of all possible opportunities as we move towards our highly productive, low-carbon economies of the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was agreed the 2 countries will increase research links. This will include deeper collaboration between UK Catapults and French Instituts Carnot. It was confirmed during the meeting that a digital conference will be held in 2018, gathering experts from both countries on digital security, skills, artificial intelligence, data and digital government.</p>

<p>The Business and Energy Secretary also announced a Researcher Mobility Fund worth almost £90,000 a year to help forge further research links between the UK and France and encouraging further collaboration between researchers in both countries.</p>

<p>The UK and French space agencies signed a declaration of intent at the meeting, with both committing to closer working and leadership in areas, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>autonomous navigation to support the search for life on Mars: the UK Space Agency and CNES – the French equivalent – are involved in the ExoMars mission that will use a rover that can move over the surface of the red planet and a satellite in orbit above it</li>
  <li>climate science and space systems to support the development of a Space Climate Observatory: this could improve the analysis of key climate variables and support for developing countries, while placing UK and French industries at the centre of the growing, multi-billion pound Climate Services market</li>
  <li>support of satellite telecommunications services for disaster-hit regions of the Caribbean</li>
</ul>
<p>The 2 countries also committed to close working and leadership in a number of other areas, particularly looking at meeting the Clean Growth and Future of Mobility Grand Challenges set out in the Industrial Strategy. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>discussion on the formation a new bilateral group bringing together policy and research experts on zero-emission vehicles in order to help meet the commitment of both countries to end the sale of new conventional petrol and diesel cars by 2040</li>
  <li>agreement that the UK and France will work bilaterally to identify potential areas of collaboration on smart energy innovation; this will help both economies seize the opportunities presented by the move towards electric vehicles and a fully smart energy system, while creating new business opportunities for UK and French companies in a multi-billion dollar international market</li>
</ul>
<p>In conjunction with the Summit, UK Energy Minister Richard Harrington co-chaired a seminar on civil nuclear energy with Brune Poirson, France’s Minister of State in the Ministry for the Ecological and Inclusive Transition.</p>

<p>The seminar bought together senior government and industry figures from the UK and France to discuss issues of mutual interest and promote bilateral collaboration, with a particular focus on nuclear decommissioning and waste management, <abbr title=""reserearch and development"">R&amp;D</abbr>, and skills.</p>

<p>Both ministers signed a declaration of intent to signify their support for greater collaboration in decommissioning and waste management.</p>

Business and Energy Secretary discusses closer research and development ties with French ministers
Business and Energy Secretary Greg Clark has met with French ministers to discuss our approach to shared challenges.
Published 18 January 2018
From:
Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, The Rt Hon Greg Clark MP, and Richard  Harrington MP
countries committed to working more closely on research and innovation across sectors including artificial intelligence, space and climate change
Energy Minister Richard Harrington also signed agreement for the 2 countries to work more closely on civil nuclear decommissioning
Business and Energy Secretary Greg Clark met with French ministers Brune Poirson, Secretary of State for the Ecological and Solidarity-based Transition, and Delphine Gény-Stephann, Secretary of State for Economy and Finance, during the UK-France Summit to promote the UK’s ambitious Industrial Strategy. He underlined how closer collaboration between the 2 countries will lead to better research outcomes, using our shared distinctive strengths to meet the Grand Challenges set out in the government’s Industrial Strategy.
Innovation is at the heart of the government’s Industrial Strategy, and the Business and Energy Secretary highlighted the importance of sharing knowledge and resources in order to meet the shared economic and environmental challenges facing the 2 countries.
After the meeting, Business and Energy Secretary Greg Clark said:
Innovation and collaboration with our international partners are at the heart of our modern Industrial Strategy. If we are to seize the opportunities and meet the challenges of the future, we need to work closely with countries that share our ambition.
France is the UK’s third largest trading partner and we want to take advantage of all possible opportunities as we move towards our highly productive, low-carbon economies of the future.
It was agreed the 2 countries will increase research links. This will include deeper collaboration between UK Catapults and French Instituts Carnot. It was confirmed during the meeting that a digital conference will be held in 2018, gathering experts from both countries on digital security, skills, artificial intelligence, data and digital government.
The Business and Energy Secretary also announced a Researcher Mobility Fund worth almost £90,000 a year to help forge further research links between the UK and France and encouraging further collaboration between researchers in both countries.
The UK and French space agencies signed a declaration of intent at the meeting, with both committing to closer working and leadership in areas, including:
autonomous navigation to support the search for life on Mars: the UK Space Agency and CNES – the French equivalent – are involved in the ExoMars mission that will use a rover that can move over the surface of the red planet and a satellite in orbit above it
climate science and space systems to support the development of a Space Climate Observatory: this could improve the analysis of key climate variables and support for developing countries, while placing UK and French industries at the centre of the growing, multi-billion pound Climate Services market
support of satellite telecommunications services for disaster-hit regions of the Caribbean
The 2 countries also committed to close working and leadership in a number of other areas, particularly looking at meeting the Clean Growth and Future of Mobility Grand Challenges set out in the Industrial Strategy. These include:
discussion on the formation a new bilateral group bringing together policy and research experts on zero-emission vehicles in order to help meet the commitment of both countries to end the sale of new conventional petrol and diesel cars by 2040
agreement that the UK and France will work bilaterally to identify potential areas of collaboration on smart energy innovation; this will help both economies seize the opportunities presented by the move towards electric vehicles and a fully smart energy system, while creating new business opportunities for UK and French companies in a multi-billion dollar international market
In conjunction with the Summit, UK Energy Minister Richard Harrington co-chaired a seminar on civil nuclear energy with Brune Poirson, France’s Minister of State in the Ministry for the Ecological and Inclusive Transition.
The seminar bought together senior government and industry figures from the UK and France to discuss issues of mutual interest and promote bilateral collaboration, with a particular focus on nuclear decommissioning and waste management, R&D, and skills.
Both ministers signed a declaration of intent to signify their support for greater collaboration in decommissioning and waste management.

      <div class=""govspeak"">
<p>Following a referral from the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, the Competition and Markets Authority (<abbr title=""Competition and Markets Authority"">CMA</abbr>) has been investigating the deal on two grounds: media plurality and commitment to broadcasting standards.</p>

<p>The <abbr title=""Competition and Markets Authority"">CMA</abbr> has provisionally found that Fox taking full control of Sky is not in the public interest due to media plurality concerns, but not because of a lack of a genuine commitment to meeting broadcasting standards in the UK.</p>

<p>The media plurality concerns identified mean that, overall, the <abbr title=""Competition and Markets Authority"">CMA</abbr> provisionally concludes that the proposed transaction is not in the public interest.</p>

<p>Further detail is set out below.</p>

<h3 id=""media-plurality"">Media Plurality</h3>

<p>Media plurality goes to the heart of the UK’s democratic process and as such is given protection in law.</p>

<p>The <abbr title=""Competition and Markets Authority"">CMA</abbr> has provisionally found that if the deal went ahead, as currently proposed, it is likely to operate against the public interest. It would lead to the Murdoch Family Trust (<abbr title=""Murdoch Family Trust"">MFT</abbr>), which controls Fox and News Corporation (News Corp), increasing its control over Sky, so that it would have too much control over news providers in the UK across all media platforms (TV, Radio, Online and Newspapers), and therefore too much influence over public opinion and the political agenda.</p>

<p>The <abbr title=""Murdoch Family Trust"">MFT</abbr>’s news outlets are watched, read or heard by nearly a third of the UK’s population, and have a combined share of the public’s news consumption that is significantly greater than all other news providers, except the BBC and ITN.</p>

<p>Due to its control of News Corp, the Murdoch family already has significant influence over public opinion and full ownership of Sky by Fox would strengthen this even further.</p>

<p>While there are a range of other news outlets serving UK audiences, the <abbr title=""Competition and Markets Authority"">CMA</abbr> has provisionally found that they would not be sufficient to moderate or mitigate the increased influence of the <abbr title=""Murdoch Family Trust"">MFT</abbr> if the deal went ahead.</p>

<h3 id=""broadcasting-standards"">Broadcasting standards</h3>

<p>The <abbr title=""Competition and Markets Authority"">CMA</abbr>’s investigation also examined a range of evidence to understand whether Fox, Sky and the <abbr title=""Murdoch Family Trust"">MFT</abbr> have a genuine commitment to broadcasting standards in the UK. Here, it has provisionally found that Fox taking full control of Sky is not likely to operate against the public interest.</p>

<p>Its investigation has provisionally concluded that, overall, Fox has a genuine commitment to broadcasting standards in the UK. It is an established broadcaster here, having held licences for over 20 years. The <abbr title=""Competition and Markets Authority"">CMA</abbr> took account of the policies and procedures Fox has in place to ensure broadcasting standards are met.</p>

<p>It found that while there were issues with the compliance arrangements at Fox News when it was broadcasting its unedited simulcast international feed into the UK, this did not outweigh the detailed and effective policies and procedures that Fox has in place in relation to its UK focused channels.</p>

<p>The <abbr title=""Competition and Markets Authority"">CMA</abbr> also provisionally found that Sky has a good record in this regard, consistently complying with broadcasting regulation. It also has comprehensive and effective policies and procedures in place to ensure broadcasting standards are met.</p>

<p>Its investigation took account of the fact that before 2012 there were serious shortcomings at the <abbr title=""Murdoch Family Trust"">MFT</abbr> controlled newspaper the News of the World, which had failed to comply with both press standards and the law.</p>

<p>However, News Corp has subsequently put in place processes and procedures to address these. The <abbr title=""Competition and Markets Authority"">CMA</abbr> has provisionally found that, since then, its newspapers’ record of compliance with press standards does not raise concerns.</p>

<p>The investigation also considered the recent allegations of sexual harassment against Fox News employees in the United States.</p>

<p>While these are serious, the <abbr title=""Competition and Markets Authority"">CMA</abbr> has provisionally found that these are not directly related to the attainment of broadcasting standards and do not call into question Fox’s or the <abbr title=""Murdoch Family Trust"">MFT</abbr>’s commitment to broadcasting standards in the UK.</p>

<p>Anne Lambert, Chair of the independent investigation Group, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Media plurality goes to the heart of our democratic process. It is very important that no group or individual should have too much control of our news media or too much power to affect the political agenda.</p>

  <p>We have provisionally found that if the Fox/Sky merger went ahead as proposed, it would be against the public interest. It would result in the Murdoch family having too much control over news providers in the UK, and too much influence over public opinion and the political agenda.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">Our in-depth investigation also considered whether the deal would be against the public interest regarding broadcasting standards. Due to their existing track record in the UK, and the range of policies and procedures the companies involved have in place to ensure broadcasting standards are met, we did not find public interest concerns in this regard.</p>

<p>The <abbr title=""Competition and Markets Authority"">CMA</abbr> has now set out a series of potential options for addressing these problems identified in its <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/twenty-first-century-fox-sky-merger-european-intervention-notice#provisional-findings"">public remedies notice</a>.</p>

Press release
CMA provisionally finds Fox/Sky deal not in the public interest
The CMA has today published the provisional findings from its in-depth examination of the proposed acquisition of Sky Plc by 21st Century Fox.
Published 23 January 2018
From:
Competition and Markets Authority
Following a referral from the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has been investigating the deal on two grounds: media plurality and commitment to broadcasting standards.
The CMA has provisionally found that Fox taking full control of Sky is not in the public interest due to media plurality concerns, but not because of a lack of a genuine commitment to meeting broadcasting standards in the UK.
The media plurality concerns identified mean that, overall, the CMA provisionally concludes that the proposed transaction is not in the public interest.
Further detail is set out below.
Media Plurality
Media plurality goes to the heart of the UK’s democratic process and as such is given protection in law.
The CMA has provisionally found that if the deal went ahead, as currently proposed, it is likely to operate against the public interest. It would lead to the Murdoch Family Trust (MFT), which controls Fox and News Corporation (News Corp), increasing its control over Sky, so that it would have too much control over news providers in the UK across all media platforms (TV, Radio, Online and Newspapers), and therefore too much influence over public opinion and the political agenda.
The MFT’s news outlets are watched, read or heard by nearly a third of the UK’s population, and have a combined share of the public’s news consumption that is significantly greater than all other news providers, except the BBC and ITN.
Due to its control of News Corp, the Murdoch family already has significant influence over public opinion and full ownership of Sky by Fox would strengthen this even further.
While there are a range of other news outlets serving UK audiences, the CMA has provisionally found that they would not be sufficient to moderate or mitigate the increased influence of the MFT if the deal went ahead.
Broadcasting standards
The CMA’s investigation also examined a range of evidence to understand whether Fox, Sky and the MFT have a genuine commitment to broadcasting standards in the UK. Here, it has provisionally found that Fox taking full control of Sky is not likely to operate against the public interest.
Its investigation has provisionally concluded that, overall, Fox has a genuine commitment to broadcasting standards in the UK. It is an established broadcaster here, having held licences for over 20 years. The CMA took account of the policies and procedures Fox has in place to ensure broadcasting standards are met.
It found that while there were issues with the compliance arrangements at Fox News when it was broadcasting its unedited simulcast international feed into the UK, this did not outweigh the detailed and effective policies and procedures that Fox has in place in relation to its UK focused channels.
The CMA also provisionally found that Sky has a good record in this regard, consistently complying with broadcasting regulation. It also has comprehensive and effective policies and procedures in place to ensure broadcasting standards are met.
Its investigation took account of the fact that before 2012 there were serious shortcomings at the MFT controlled newspaper the News of the World, which had failed to comply with both press standards and the law.
However, News Corp has subsequently put in place processes and procedures to address these. The CMA has provisionally found that, since then, its newspapers’ record of compliance with press standards does not raise concerns.
The investigation also considered the recent allegations of sexual harassment against Fox News employees in the United States.
While these are serious, the CMA has provisionally found that these are not directly related to the attainment of broadcasting standards and do not call into question Fox’s or the MFT’s commitment to broadcasting standards in the UK.
Anne Lambert, Chair of the independent investigation Group, said:
Media plurality goes to the heart of our democratic process. It is very important that no group or individual should have too much control of our news media or too much power to affect the political agenda.
We have provisionally found that if the Fox/Sky merger went ahead as proposed, it would be against the public interest. It would result in the Murdoch family having too much control over news providers in the UK, and too much influence over public opinion and the political agenda.
Our in-depth investigation also considered whether the deal would be against the public interest regarding broadcasting standards. Due to their existing track record in the UK, and the range of policies and procedures the companies involved have in place to ensure broadcasting standards are met, we did not find public interest concerns in this regard.
Next steps
The CMA has now set out a series of potential options for addressing these problems identified in its public remedies notice.
It also now welcomes responses from interested parties to its provisional decision and proposed possible remedies, including in view of the announcement by Fox on 14 December 2017 that it had agreed the sale of certain assets, including its interests in Sky, to The Walt Disney Company.
These will be carefully considered before the CMA’s report is finalised and provided to the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport by 1 May 2018. He will then make the final decision on the proposed deal.
Notes to editors
The CMA is the UK’s primary competition and consumer authority. It is an independent non-ministerial government department with responsibility for carrying out investigations into mergers, markets and the regulated industries and enforcing competition and consumer law.
On 20 September 2017 the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport referred the proposed deal to the CMA for investigation under the Enterprise Act 2002 (Protection of Legitimate Interests) Order 2003. The CMA appointed an inquiry group - formed of independent panel members with a variety of backgrounds -  to investigate, decide and report on the question set out in the reference.
The inquiry group has until 1 May 2018 to provide the Secretary of State its final report. The final decision regarding the questions addressed in the CMA’s report will be made by the Secretary of State following receipt of the report.
There is now a 3-week consultation period on the provisional findings, during which time anyone may make submissions to the CMA. Submissions should be made to FoxSky.Submissions@cma.gsi.gov.uk and received by Tuesday 13 February 2018. There is a 2-week consultation period on the notice of possible remedies. Submissions on this should be made to FoxSky.Submissions@cma.gsi.gov.uk and received by Tuesday 6 February 2018.
The CMA’s case page sets out an explanation about its process, including the steps followed, the submissions received, hearings held, documents published, and upcoming deadlines.

<p>Some 16 local projects have been funded by the A14 Community Fund since it launched in July 2016. The initiative was launched by Highways England to fund projects connecting local communities with the A14 upgrade, and it has already been making a difference within the communities living along the road in Cambridgeshire.</p>

<p>The £400,000 funding pot was launched in July 2016 and £110,000 of it has already been allocated to projects ranging from education and environment, to encouraging cycling and walking.</p>

<p>Gerard Smith, legacy lead for the A14 Cambridge to Huntingdon project at Highways England, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This different approach to community engagement is a first for Highways England.</p>

  <p>We care about the impact our road improvement projects have on people’s lives and at the same time, we understand the critically important role that communities play in shaping our schemes as well as the economic, social and physical landscape around them.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">An initiative like the A14 Community Fund makes it possible for us to support community-led projects that will leave a positive legacy for the local area long after we have finished our construction work and the new road is open to traffic. And I’m delighted to say it’s been very successful in supporting great projects so far.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Grants of up to a maximum value of £10,000 are available to people living along the A14 in Cambridgeshire in a series of quarterly grant rounds until the end of the project in December 2020 or when all the money has been allocated – whichever comes soonest.</p>

<p>There have been five rounds so far, with more opportunities coming up to bid for grants to support projects across a wide range of areas including the environment, health and well-being, heritage, arts, skills, and culture.</p>

<p>As examples, projects could:</p>

<ul>
<li>focus on the new leisure opportunities opened up by the scheme</li>
  <li>chronicle changes to the local area over time</li>
  <li>complement the environmental measures being put in place</li>
  <li>revisit how public spaces are used</li>
</ul>
<p>Gerard added:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We realise it can be daunting for small organisations to write a grant application for the first time. Initially, we noticed people found it hard to demonstrate how their project linked to the A14 road improvement project. We have now put in place a two-stage process which encourages applicants to talk to our team so we can help them frame their project to give it the best chances.</p>

  <p>Most of the best projects we’ve seen are the ones where the bidders have worked closely with our team at design stage to understand the wider impacts.</p>

  <p>We’ve had some great bids so far and I am sure there are more to come. What we’d really like to see are bids that build on the positive legacy we are leaving with the road improvement scheme: a much improved network of cycling and walking routes that communities can link into or capitalising on improved access to areas which didn’t have it before for instance.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">I look forward to seeing the bids we get for this and future rounds!</p>

<h3 id=""case-study-1-university-of-cambridge-institute-of-continuing-education-a14-writer-in-residence"">Case study 1: University of Cambridge Institute of Continuing Education A14 Writer in Residence</h3>

<p>The University of Cambridge Institute of Continuing Education (ICE), successfully bid for funding last year for a post of A14 Writer in Residence based at Madingley Hall, a stone’s throw from the A14 in Cambridgeshire.</p>

<p>The post was taken up by Daisy Johnson, a librarian, children’s writer and blogger from York, from 6 September. 
Since then, Daisy has been encouraging people living and travelling along the A14 in Cambridgeshire to reflect on roads and the nature of travel via a series of free creative writing initiatives including face to face courses, pop up sessions, visits to schools and a Facebook page where she has been offering regular writing prompts to followers.</p>

<p>The hope is for local people from all walks of life to re-discover their love of stories, and the ultimate outcome will be for all involved to contribute to an anthology to be launched at a free event held at Madingley Hall this March.</p>

<p>Midge Gillies, Academic Director, Creative Writing, University of Cambridge Institute of Continuing Education, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our A14 Writer in Residence, Daisy Johnson, has done a wonderful job of taking ideas about travel to many corners of the community. She has been particularly successful at engaging youngsters who see travel in a completely different way – you’re stuck in a traffic jam? Luckily, you’re wearing your edible outfit that will stop you from becoming peckish. Or wait till it’s dark to see the dragon races along the A14.</p>

  <p>Daisy has also been active on Facebook where the A14 Stories site has persuaded people to think about their local community and to write something creative – often for the first time or after a very long gap.</p>

  <p>And we’ve been thrilled by the response from the diverse group of students (and one lovely hearing dog) who have turned up to our three, free creative writing courses.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">Roads take us to school, on holiday, to hospital, to a wedding or a funeral. We’ve all got a story about a special journey. I look forward to seeing which stories make it into the A14 writing anthology!</p>

<h3 id=""case-study-2-cambridge-science-centre-on-the-road-school-workshops"">Case study 2: Cambridge Science Centre, On the Road school workshops</h3>

<p>The Cambridge Science Centre successfully bid early last year for funding to create a new cross-disciplinary workshop for schools, aimed at years 6 to 10 (10 to 15 year olds), that ties in the environmental theme of their ‘LifeWorks!’ exhibition with engineering, using the A14 as a case study.</p>

<p>The team developed a workshop called ‘On the Road’, which investigates the materials used in road construction and looks at the environmental considerations to take into account in road building.</p>

<p>To date, the workshop has been delivered to more than 700 students living near the A14 (and some further afield), mainly in secondary schools (key stage 3) but also in a number of primary schools.</p>

<p>The workshops were tailored to the local environment and needs of the schools, with some interested in bridge construction while others looked at general construction skills, engineering or environmental science.</p>

<p>Helen Slaski, CEO of the Cambridge Science Centre, said:</p>

<p>“This funding has enabled Cambridge Science Centre to develop an exciting, hands-on workshop entitled ‘On the Road’ for the A14 project. Nearly 1,000 students throughout the East of England, particularly in areas impacted by the construction, have benefitted from this outreach programme which fulfils Cambridge Science Centre’s objectives of enhancing education and inspiring young people to think about STEM that is all around them in their daily lives. Thank you for the funding, it has made a real difference and inspired youngsters to get involved with STEM related activities.”</p>

Press release
Thousands benefit from A14 community fund
More than 2,000 people are benefitting from community grants made possible by the biggest road upgrade in the country, the £1.5bn A14 Cambridge to Huntingdon improvement project. 
Published 23 January 2018
From:
Highways England
Some 16 local projects have been funded by the A14 Community Fund since it launched in July 2016. The initiative was launched by Highways England to fund projects connecting local communities with the A14 upgrade, and it has already been making a difference within the communities living along the road in Cambridgeshire.
The £400,000 funding pot was launched in July 2016 and £110,000 of it has already been allocated to projects ranging from education and environment, to encouraging cycling and walking.
Gerard Smith, legacy lead for the A14 Cambridge to Huntingdon project at Highways England, said:
This different approach to community engagement is a first for Highways England.
We care about the impact our road improvement projects have on people’s lives and at the same time, we understand the critically important role that communities play in shaping our schemes as well as the economic, social and physical landscape around them.
An initiative like the A14 Community Fund makes it possible for us to support community-led projects that will leave a positive legacy for the local area long after we have finished our construction work and the new road is open to traffic. And I’m delighted to say it’s been very successful in supporting great projects so far.
Grants of up to a maximum value of £10,000 are available to people living along the A14 in Cambridgeshire in a series of quarterly grant rounds until the end of the project in December 2020 or when all the money has been allocated – whichever comes soonest.
There have been five rounds so far, with more opportunities coming up to bid for grants to support projects across a wide range of areas including the environment, health and well-being, heritage, arts, skills, and culture.
As examples, projects could:
focus on the new leisure opportunities opened up by the scheme
chronicle changes to the local area over time
complement the environmental measures being put in place
revisit how public spaces are used
Gerard added:
We realise it can be daunting for small organisations to write a grant application for the first time. Initially, we noticed people found it hard to demonstrate how their project linked to the A14 road improvement project. We have now put in place a two-stage process which encourages applicants to talk to our team so we can help them frame their project to give it the best chances.
Most of the best projects we’ve seen are the ones where the bidders have worked closely with our team at design stage to understand the wider impacts.
We’ve had some great bids so far and I am sure there are more to come. What we’d really like to see are bids that build on the positive legacy we are leaving with the road improvement scheme: a much improved network of cycling and walking routes that communities can link into or capitalising on improved access to areas which didn’t have it before for instance.
I look forward to seeing the bids we get for this and future rounds!
Case study 1: University of Cambridge Institute of Continuing Education A14 Writer in Residence
The University of Cambridge Institute of Continuing Education (ICE), successfully bid for funding last year for a post of A14 Writer in Residence based at Madingley Hall, a stone’s throw from the A14 in Cambridgeshire.
The post was taken up by Daisy Johnson, a librarian, children’s writer and blogger from York, from 6 September. 
Since then, Daisy has been encouraging people living and travelling along the A14 in Cambridgeshire to reflect on roads and the nature of travel via a series of free creative writing initiatives including face to face courses, pop up sessions, visits to schools and a Facebook page where she has been offering regular writing prompts to followers.
The hope is for local people from all walks of life to re-discover their love of stories, and the ultimate outcome will be for all involved to contribute to an anthology to be launched at a free event held at Madingley Hall this March.
Midge Gillies, Academic Director, Creative Writing, University of Cambridge Institute of Continuing Education, said:
Our A14 Writer in Residence, Daisy Johnson, has done a wonderful job of taking ideas about travel to many corners of the community. She has been particularly successful at engaging youngsters who see travel in a completely different way – you’re stuck in a traffic jam? Luckily, you’re wearing your edible outfit that will stop you from becoming peckish. Or wait till it’s dark to see the dragon races along the A14.
Daisy has also been active on Facebook where the A14 Stories site has persuaded people to think about their local community and to write something creative – often for the first time or after a very long gap.
And we’ve been thrilled by the response from the diverse group of students (and one lovely hearing dog) who have turned up to our three, free creative writing courses.
Roads take us to school, on holiday, to hospital, to a wedding or a funeral. We’ve all got a story about a special journey. I look forward to seeing which stories make it into the A14 writing anthology!
Case study 2: Cambridge Science Centre, On the Road school workshops
The Cambridge Science Centre successfully bid early last year for funding to create a new cross-disciplinary workshop for schools, aimed at years 6 to 10 (10 to 15 year olds), that ties in the environmental theme of their ‘LifeWorks!’ exhibition with engineering, using the A14 as a case study.
The team developed a workshop called ‘On the Road’, which investigates the materials used in road construction and looks at the environmental considerations to take into account in road building.
To date, the workshop has been delivered to more than 700 students living near the A14 (and some further afield), mainly in secondary schools (key stage 3) but also in a number of primary schools.
The workshops were tailored to the local environment and needs of the schools, with some interested in bridge construction while others looked at general construction skills, engineering or environmental science.

<p>HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title=""HM Revenue and Customs"">HMRC</abbr>) has stopped thousands of taxpayers from receiving scam text messages, with 90 percent of the most convincing texts now halted before they reach their phones.</p>

<p>The milestone comes during Take Five To Stop Fraud Week, with the tax authority working to raise awareness of the tell-tale signs of fraud ahead of the Self Assessment deadline.</p>

<p>Fraudsters alleging to be from <abbr title=""HM Revenue and Customs"">HMRC</abbr> send text messages to unsuspecting members of the public. In these messages they will make false claims, such as suggesting they are due a tax rebate. Messages will usually include links to websites that harvest personal information or spread malware. This can in turn lead to identity fraud and the theft of people’s personal savings.</p>

<p><abbr title=""HM Revenue and Customs"">HMRC</abbr> will never contact customers who are due a tax refund by text message or by email.</p>

<p>Reports of this type of fraud have quickly increased in volume over the last few years. People are 9 times more likely to fall for text message scams than other forms like email because they can appear more legitimate, with many texts displaying ‘<abbr title=""HM Revenue and Customs"">HMRC</abbr>’ as the sender, rather than a phone number.</p>

<p><abbr title=""HM Revenue and Customs"">HMRC</abbr>, working with public and private partners, began a pilot in April 2017 to combat these messages. The new technology identifies fraud texts with ‘tags’ that suggest they are from <abbr title=""HM Revenue and Customs"">HMRC</abbr> and stops them from being delivered.</p>

<p>Since the pilot began, there has been a 90% reduction in customer reports around the spoofing of these specific <abbr title=""HM Revenue and Customs"">HMRC</abbr>-related tags on SMS and a five-fold reduction in malicious SMS reports. The initiative has helped reduce reports of these scams from over 5,000 in March 2017, before the new programme was introduced, to fewer than 1,000 in December 2017. This progress comes after similar successes in tackling fraudulent emails and websites.</p>

<p>In the last 12 months, <abbr title=""HM Revenue and Customs"">HMRC</abbr> has initiated the removal of 16,000 malicious websites, meaning even if the texts are delivered, the associated phishing website is likely to have been removed.</p>

<p>By introducing technical controls, <abbr title=""HM Revenue and Customs"">HMRC</abbr> has also stopped customers receiving over 300 million emails purporting to come from the tax authority.</p>

<p><abbr title=""HM Revenue and Customs"">HMRC</abbr>’s Director of Customer Services, Angela MacDonald, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><abbr title=""HM Revenue and Customs"">HMRC</abbr> is focused on becoming the most digitally advanced tax authority in the world, and a big part of that relates to keeping our customers safe from online scammers.</p>

  <p>As email and website scams become less effective, fraudsters are increasingly turning to text messages to con taxpayers. But as these numbers show, we won’t rest until these criminals are out of avenues to exploit.</p>

Press release
HMRC halts thousands of scam text messages
As part of Take Five to Stop Fraud Week, the tax authority explains its work to protect customers from text message scammers.
Published 25 January 2018
From:
HM Revenue & Customs
HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has stopped thousands of taxpayers from receiving scam text messages, with 90 percent of the most convincing texts now halted before they reach their phones.
The milestone comes during Take Five To Stop Fraud Week, with the tax authority working to raise awareness of the tell-tale signs of fraud ahead of the Self Assessment deadline.
Fraudsters alleging to be from HMRC send text messages to unsuspecting members of the public. In these messages they will make false claims, such as suggesting they are due a tax rebate. Messages will usually include links to websites that harvest personal information or spread malware. This can in turn lead to identity fraud and the theft of people’s personal savings.
HMRC will never contact customers who are due a tax refund by text message or by email.
Reports of this type of fraud have quickly increased in volume over the last few years. People are 9 times more likely to fall for text message scams than other forms like email because they can appear more legitimate, with many texts displaying ‘HMRC’ as the sender, rather than a phone number.
HMRC, working with public and private partners, began a pilot in April 2017 to combat these messages. The new technology identifies fraud texts with ‘tags’ that suggest they are from HMRC and stops them from being delivered.
Since the pilot began, there has been a 90% reduction in customer reports around the spoofing of these specific HMRC-related tags on SMS and a five-fold reduction in malicious SMS reports. The initiative has helped reduce reports of these scams from over 5,000 in March 2017, before the new programme was introduced, to fewer than 1,000 in December 2017. This progress comes after similar successes in tackling fraudulent emails and websites.
In the last 12 months, HMRC has initiated the removal of 16,000 malicious websites, meaning even if the texts are delivered, the associated phishing website is likely to have been removed.
By introducing technical controls, HMRC has also stopped customers receiving over 300 million emails purporting to come from the tax authority.
HMRC’s Director of Customer Services, Angela MacDonald, said:
HMRC is focused on becoming the most digitally advanced tax authority in the world, and a big part of that relates to keeping our customers safe from online scammers.
As email and website scams become less effective, fraudsters are increasingly turning to text messages to con taxpayers. But as these numbers show, we won’t rest until these criminals are out of avenues to exploit.
We have made significant progress is cutting down these types of crime, but one of the most effective ways to tackle it is still to help the public spot the tell-tale signs of fraud.
HMRC is working with the National Cyber Security Centre to further this work and extend the benefits beyond HMRC customers.

<p>Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Hillier, visited the site of the new £10m Remote Radar Head facility, at Saxa Vord, Unst, Shetland, to inspect its progress.</p>

<p>The radar will improve RAF and NATO understanding of the airspace north of Britain and further out across the Norwegian Sea, improving the UK’s sovereign capability at a time of heightened Russian military activity. It will see the island return to the role it performed during the 1960s and 70s, when the site was used as an early warning radar on NATO’s northern flank.</p>

<p>Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">We will always protect our skies from Russian aggression. This radar is a vital part of the UK’s defences as we react to intensifying global threats and reinforce our ability to tackle them. Russia’s actions are not limited to Europe’s eastern borders ­– the threat to British livelihoods is severe and real.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Hillier, Chief of the Air Staff, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The radar system at Saxa Vord is an important part of ensuring that the RAF can fully protect both the UK’s airspace and that of our NATO allies, in the face of increasing pressure from Russia.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">Right at the tip of Shetland, Saxa Vord is a very remote site, so I’m extremely grateful to the team who have been working hard through the cold of winter, with snow and 120 mph gales, to ensure that the construction has remained on schedule.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Saxa Vord Radar head will provide key information on aircraft movements to the north of the UK and feed the nationwide Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) operation which is responsible for policing international and UK airspace from RAF Lossiemouth in Moray and RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire, as well as supporting civil air traffic control.</p>

<p>During the last five years, the RAF has carried out 69 QRA launches. Just last week (15 Jan), two Typhoon aircraft from RAF Lossiemouth were scrambled to intercept two approaching Russian military aircraft which did not respond to the air traffic control authorities.</p>

<p>The RAF monitored the jets as they passed through international airspace, before escorting the Russian Blackjacks out of the UK’s area of interest.  At no time did the Russian bombers enter UK sovereign airspace.</p>

<p>Defence, Equipment and Support, the MOD’s procurement organisation, managed the redevelopment of the site and delivered the new infrastructure and capability for the RAF, commissioning the works through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) Services. The Saxa Vord remote radar head will be operated remotely by RAF personnel and contractors will only attend the site for maintenance.</p>

<p>Simon Dakin, Director Intelligence Surveillance Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance, for Defence Equipment and Support, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">The Air Defence and Electronic Warfare Delivery Team has shown outstanding innovation and teamwork to deliver this vital capability ahead of time and within budget.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>During his two day visit to Shetland, Sir Stephen Hillier also toured the adjacent Saxa Vord RAF and Exhibition Centre and met representatives from Shetland Islands Council, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, Sullom Voe and Shetland Space Centre Ltd, as well as delivery personnel from FCO Services &amp; ADEWS, Brody-Forbes, 90 SU, Serco, Mobile Met Unit and McDonald Scaffolding.</p>

<p>Scotland is home to more than 10,000 regular and 4,000 reserve armed forces personnel, whilst Scottish industry benefits from defence spending £1.5bn with it each year. This investment supports 9,750 private sector and highly skilled jobs in Scotland.</p>

New Shetland radar to better protect UK Northern airspace
A new RAF radar facility reinforcing the UK’s ability to track unidentified military or civilian aircraft will be powered up ready to operate soon, the head of the RAF heard today.
Published 26 January 2018
From:
Ministry of Defence and Defence Equipment and Support
Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Hillier, visited the site of the new £10m Remote Radar Head facility, at Saxa Vord, Unst, Shetland, to inspect its progress.
The radar will improve RAF and NATO understanding of the airspace north of Britain and further out across the Norwegian Sea, improving the UK’s sovereign capability at a time of heightened Russian military activity. It will see the island return to the role it performed during the 1960s and 70s, when the site was used as an early warning radar on NATO’s northern flank.
Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said:
We will always protect our skies from Russian aggression. This radar is a vital part of the UK’s defences as we react to intensifying global threats and reinforce our ability to tackle them. Russia’s actions are not limited to Europe’s eastern borders ­– the threat to British livelihoods is severe and real.
Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Hillier, Chief of the Air Staff, said:
The radar system at Saxa Vord is an important part of ensuring that the RAF can fully protect both the UK’s airspace and that of our NATO allies, in the face of increasing pressure from Russia.
Right at the tip of Shetland, Saxa Vord is a very remote site, so I’m extremely grateful to the team who have been working hard through the cold of winter, with snow and 120 mph gales, to ensure that the construction has remained on schedule.
The Saxa Vord Radar head will provide key information on aircraft movements to the north of the UK and feed the nationwide Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) operation which is responsible for policing international and UK airspace from RAF Lossiemouth in Moray and RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire, as well as supporting civil air traffic control.
During the last five years, the RAF has carried out 69 QRA launches. Just last week (15 Jan), two Typhoon aircraft from RAF Lossiemouth were scrambled to intercept two approaching Russian military aircraft which did not respond to the air traffic control authorities.
The RAF monitored the jets as they passed through international airspace, before escorting the Russian Blackjacks out of the UK’s area of interest.  At no time did the Russian bombers enter UK sovereign airspace.
Defence, Equipment and Support, the MOD’s procurement organisation, managed the redevelopment of the site and delivered the new infrastructure and capability for the RAF, commissioning the works through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) Services. The Saxa Vord remote radar head will be operated remotely by RAF personnel and contractors will only attend the site for maintenance.
Simon Dakin, Director Intelligence Surveillance Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance, for Defence Equipment and Support, said:
The Air Defence and Electronic Warfare Delivery Team has shown outstanding innovation and teamwork to deliver this vital capability ahead of time and within budget.
During his two day visit to Shetland, Sir Stephen Hillier also toured the adjacent Saxa Vord RAF and Exhibition Centre and met representatives from Shetland Islands Council, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, Sullom Voe and Shetland Space Centre Ltd, as well as delivery personnel from FCO Services & ADEWS, Brody-Forbes, 90 SU, Serco, Mobile Met Unit and McDonald Scaffolding.
Scotland is home to more than 10,000 regular and 4,000 reserve armed forces personnel, whilst Scottish industry benefits from defence spending £1.5bn with it each year. This investment supports 9,750 private sector and highly skilled jobs in Scotland.

Prime Minister's statement at Stormont House
Transcript of the Prime Minister's statement at Stormont House in Northern Ireland.

From:
Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Theresa May MP
Delivered on: 
12 February 2018 (Transcript of the speech, exactly as it was delivered)
Prime Minister
Today I have been meeting the leaders of the main parties involved in the talks and I have urged them to make one final push for the sake of the people here in Northern Ireland.
It has been thirteen long months since we last saw devolved government here and I think we are now at the point of where it is time for the locally elected representatives to find a way to work together and to deal with and tackle the many pressing issues facing Northern Ireland.
I have had full and frank conversations with the five parties. I’ve also met with the Taoiseach.
And while some differences remain I believe that it is possible to see the basis of an agreement here. There is the basis of an agreement and it should be possible to see an Executive up and running in Northern Ireland very soon.
The DUP and Sinn Fein have been working very hard to close the remaining gaps. But I would also like to recognise the contribution of other parties here in Northern Ireland too.
What I am clear about is that we are all fully committed to doing everything we can to support this process – and as far as Westminster is concerned we stand ready to  legislate  for the re-establishment of an Executive as soon as possible after an agreement.

<p>William Robert Howard (45) director of the now liquidated Expeditors Limited has entered into an undertaking that prevents him from acting as a director for 12 years.</p>

<p>The mobile phone business was incorporated in 2004 and a petition was made to wind up Expeditors Limited in June 2017 by HM Revenue &amp; Customs regarding an unpaid VAT bill of £22,545.40.</p>

<p>The Insolvency Service then conducted an investigation, which focused on the mobile phone company’s participation in a form of VAT fraud known as Missing Trader Intra Community fraud (MTIC).</p>

<p>Commonly known as ‘carousel’ fraud, MITC fraud sees large consignments of high-value electrical or small items invoiced rapidly and repeatedly around trading chains. On paper the goods look like they are being moved repeatedly from customer to customer but the goods are only moved as they enter or exit the UK.</p>

<p>In the case of Expeditors Limited, William Howard used the scheme to offset VAT and reclaim close to £350,000 in its 2005 to 2006 VAT return.</p>

<p>Examples of MITC conducted by William Howard were indicated by the rapid succession of same-day trades within the UK but goods weren’t delivered and remained on a shared freight forwarder, there were common uses of the same offshore bank, as well as payments being arranged with third parties who were neither suppliers nor customers.</p>

<p>Additionally, all the traders banked with the First Curacao International Bank which was shut down by the Netherlands Antilles authorities in September 2006 in order to prevent money laundering.</p>

<p>William Howard’s disqualification started on 5 February 2018 and means that he cannot promote, manage, or be a director of a limited company until 2030.</p>

<p>Anthony Hannon, Official Receiver in the Public Interest Unit of the Insolvency Service, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">This type of VAT fraud is very serious and a high priority for HMRC and the Insolvency Service.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">MTIC fraud has caused loss to the public purse and has cost the tax payer substantial sums in fraudulent VAT claims. The Insolvency Service is committed to making directors accountable for their actions.</p>

Press release
Oxford mobile phone dealer handed 12 year disqualification
A director of an Oxford wholesale mobile phone company has been banned from running a business for his part in a VAT fraud scheme.
Published 15 February 2018
From:
The Insolvency Service
William Robert Howard (45) director of the now liquidated Expeditors Limited has entered into an undertaking that prevents him from acting as a director for 12 years.
The mobile phone business was incorporated in 2004 and a petition was made to wind up Expeditors Limited in June 2017 by HM Revenue & Customs regarding an unpaid VAT bill of £22,545.40.
The Insolvency Service then conducted an investigation, which focused on the mobile phone company’s participation in a form of VAT fraud known as Missing Trader Intra Community fraud (MTIC).
Commonly known as ‘carousel’ fraud, MITC fraud sees large consignments of high-value electrical or small items invoiced rapidly and repeatedly around trading chains. On paper the goods look like they are being moved repeatedly from customer to customer but the goods are only moved as they enter or exit the UK.
In the case of Expeditors Limited, William Howard used the scheme to offset VAT and reclaim close to £350,000 in its 2005 to 2006 VAT return.
Examples of MITC conducted by William Howard were indicated by the rapid succession of same-day trades within the UK but goods weren’t delivered and remained on a shared freight forwarder, there were common uses of the same offshore bank, as well as payments being arranged with third parties who were neither suppliers nor customers.
Additionally, all the traders banked with the First Curacao International Bank which was shut down by the Netherlands Antilles authorities in September 2006 in order to prevent money laundering.
William Howard’s disqualification started on 5 February 2018 and means that he cannot promote, manage, or be a director of a limited company until 2030.
Anthony Hannon, Official Receiver in the Public Interest Unit of the Insolvency Service, said:
This type of VAT fraud is very serious and a high priority for HMRC and the Insolvency Service.
MTIC fraud has caused loss to the public purse and has cost the tax payer substantial sums in fraudulent VAT claims. The Insolvency Service is committed to making directors accountable for their actions.

      <div class=""govspeak"">
<p>Thank you Mr President, and thank you also to Under Secretary General Lowcock for your very detailed and clear briefing today. It was very powerful to hear through you the voices of the people of Eastern Ghouta.</p>

<p>Mr President,</p>

<p>Russia called this meeting today to allow us to present our understanding of the situation on the ground and to come up with ways of getting out of this situation. Well, we’ve heard very clearly from Under Secretary General Lowcock today and from the Secretary General yesterday about the situation on the ground.</p>

<p>This is hell on earth.</p>

<p>The scale of the human suffering and destruction is unbearable.</p>

<p>The suffering of the Syrian people, while primarily the responsibility of the Syrian regime, brings shame on all of us in this Council.</p>

<p>Let us be very clear about the main cause of this hell on earth. It’s the direct result of an escalation by the Syrian regime of its aerial bombardment of civilian areas using cluster bombs, alleged chemical weapons use and systematically killing hundreds of its own civilians.</p>

<p>As others in this chamber have said today, these are breaches of international humanitarian law and are war crimes.</p>

<p>The UK will be unrelenting in our campaign to ensure accountability and justice for these crimes using all mechanisms at our disposal.</p>

<p>Mr President,</p>

<p>We owe it to the people of Eastern Ghouta to highlight the utter devastation facing them and then to take measures to stop it.</p>

<p>According to the Syrian American Medical Society, in the first 48 hours of this week, 250 civilians have been killed and 460 injured. Those that survived these attacks have been further targeted by the regime whilst trying to get help for their injuries. There have been 22 separate attacks on 20 different hospitals in the three days since Monday. We applaud the incredible work of the brave doctors on the ground who risk their own lives to save others. And like the Netherlands, we salute the heroes of the White Helmets who have demonstrated incredible bravery, courage and resilience to save the lives of thousands of Syrians from all sides of this conflict.</p>

<p>From the start of this conflict the Assad regime has peddled the myth that all of those opposing Assad are terrorists. This is manifestly not the case. The people of Eastern Ghouta are not terrorists. Jabhat al-Nusra have only a small presence in Eastern Ghouta; their fighters numbering less than a quarter of one percent of the population of that area. Nothing can justify the barbaric bombardment we’ve seen in recent days, or the blocking of humanitarian aid, or the denial of medical evacuations.</p>

<p>We also condemn the mortar shelling from Eastern Ghouta of civilian areas of Damascus and attacks against the Russian Embassy in Damascus.</p>

<p>Mr President,</p>

<p>This Council has failed to uphold its responsibilities in Syria. We all know why this is. But we have all agreed that there can be no military solution to the conflict, only a political one. The actions of the Assad regime in recent weeks, the military escalation in an area guaranteed by Russia and Iran as a “de-escalation zone” shows cynical disregard by the regime for every member of this Council and for our resolution. So it is vital that we all send a clear and unified message in response.</p>

<p>The solution to this situation is not difficult. We need to see an immediate cessation of hostilities, including an immediate end to the aerial bombing of Eastern Ghouta. If everyone in this chamber were to commit to this unequivocally today, it could have an impact on the ground. It could save the lives of thousands of innocent men, women and children who are being killed as we speak here today in this chamber. We therefore welcome the resolution put forward into blue by you, Mr President, and by Sweden, and we look forward to a vote later today.</p>

<p>To conclude Mr President,</p>

<p>Yesterday, we discussed the principles of the UN Charter which our predecessors drafted in the name of the peoples of the world to help save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. It’s clear we have fallen woefully short of this aim. We have failed the people of Eastern Ghouta. But let us reverse this trend today. Let us adopt your draft resolution and take the concrete actions needed to ease the suffering in this zone of death and destruction.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

Speech
Call to Stop the Devastation Facing the People of Eastern Ghouta
English
Русский
Statement by Stephen Hickey, Acting UK Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations, at the Security Council Briefing on Eastern Ghouta.
Published 23 February 2018
From:
Foreign & Commonwealth Office
Delivered on: 
22 February 2018 (Transcript of the speech, exactly as it was delivered)
Thank you Mr President, and thank you also to Under Secretary General Lowcock for your very detailed and clear briefing today. It was very powerful to hear through you the voices of the people of Eastern Ghouta.
Mr President,
Russia called this meeting today to allow us to present our understanding of the situation on the ground and to come up with ways of getting out of this situation. Well, we’ve heard very clearly from Under Secretary General Lowcock today and from the Secretary General yesterday about the situation on the ground.
This is hell on earth.
The scale of the human suffering and destruction is unbearable.
The suffering of the Syrian people, while primarily the responsibility of the Syrian regime, brings shame on all of us in this Council.
Let us be very clear about the main cause of this hell on earth. It’s the direct result of an escalation by the Syrian regime of its aerial bombardment of civilian areas using cluster bombs, alleged chemical weapons use and systematically killing hundreds of its own civilians.
As others in this chamber have said today, these are breaches of international humanitarian law and are war crimes.
The UK will be unrelenting in our campaign to ensure accountability and justice for these crimes using all mechanisms at our disposal.
Mr President,
We owe it to the people of Eastern Ghouta to highlight the utter devastation facing them and then to take measures to stop it.
According to the Syrian American Medical Society, in the first 48 hours of this week, 250 civilians have been killed and 460 injured. Those that survived these attacks have been further targeted by the regime whilst trying to get help for their injuries. There have been 22 separate attacks on 20 different hospitals in the three days since Monday. We applaud the incredible work of the brave doctors on the ground who risk their own lives to save others. And like the Netherlands, we salute the heroes of the White Helmets who have demonstrated incredible bravery, courage and resilience to save the lives of thousands of Syrians from all sides of this conflict.
From the start of this conflict the Assad regime has peddled the myth that all of those opposing Assad are terrorists. This is manifestly not the case. The people of Eastern Ghouta are not terrorists. Jabhat al-Nusra have only a small presence in Eastern Ghouta; their fighters numbering less than a quarter of one percent of the population of that area. Nothing can justify the barbaric bombardment we’ve seen in recent days, or the blocking of humanitarian aid, or the denial of medical evacuations.
We also condemn the mortar shelling from Eastern Ghouta of civilian areas of Damascus and attacks against the Russian Embassy in Damascus.
Mr President,
This Council has failed to uphold its responsibilities in Syria. We all know why this is. But we have all agreed that there can be no military solution to the conflict, only a political one. The actions of the Assad regime in recent weeks, the military escalation in an area guaranteed by Russia and Iran as a “de-escalation zone” shows cynical disregard by the regime for every member of this Council and for our resolution. So it is vital that we all send a clear and unified message in response.
The solution to this situation is not difficult. We need to see an immediate cessation of hostilities, including an immediate end to the aerial bombing of Eastern Ghouta. If everyone in this chamber were to commit to this unequivocally today, it could have an impact on the ground. It could save the lives of thousands of innocent men, women and children who are being killed as we speak here today in this chamber. We therefore welcome the resolution put forward into blue by you, Mr President, and by Sweden, and we look forward to a vote later today.
To conclude Mr President,
Yesterday, we discussed the principles of the UN Charter which our predecessors drafted in the name of the peoples of the world to help save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. It’s clear we have fallen woefully short of this aim. We have failed the people of Eastern Ghouta. But let us reverse this trend today.

Thank you.

<p>Good Morning. I’m delighted to see so many people have braved the arctic weather to be here today – thank you.</p>

<p>I know you all have incredibly busy jobs and that it’s not easy to take time away, but I do believe that you will leave at the end of the day pleased that you did make the time. I hope you will leave enthused and with the ideas, connections and tools to continue that ever important quest of providing the best support to children and their families.</p>

<p>I am delighted to have been appointed to my first ministerial role – and even more happy and elated for that role to be focusing on supporting our most vulnerable children and families. I genuinely think I have the best portfolio in the department, if not the best job in government!</p>

<p>As you know, my background is in business and in particular in market research. But if setting up and running YouGov taught me anything, it’s that if you want to really understand an issue you need to get out there and talk to the people who live and breathe it every single day.</p>

<p>So I wanted to get out and meet social workers and leaders across the country straight away – literally two days into the job I went to Hackney with our Chief Social Worker, Isabelle Trowler, to learn about how they turned that services around and to discuss our reform programme.</p>

<p>I’ve since been to Doncaster and Wigan, and have met with our Partners in Practice. I am excited and looking forward to getting out more over the coming months.</p>

<p>I can honestly say that the social workers I’ve spoken to are some of the most dedicated and inspiring people that I have had privileged pleasure to met in my life. As an MP, I would often get people in my surgery talking about their experiences with children’s social care, and it was often so overwhelming. By the end of a 15-20 minute appointment with a family, I would find it almost impossible to breathe, let alone think. You do this every day.  So I have the upmost respect and admiration for our people who do this job day in and day out.</p>

<p>I have been particularly struck by the commitment and passion of the social workers I’ve met doing the best they can for the children and families they are working with. That includes constantly looking for more effective ways of supporting children, building their understanding of what works and learning from the experience of their peers.</p>

<p>I don’t think I need to tell you that social workers are central to solving the challenges we face in children’s social care, or that investing in them is absolutely key.</p>

<p>But as leaders, you know as well as I do that enabling social workers to do the best for children is about more than training, or caseloads, or staff turnover.</p>

<p>Not that those things aren’t important - they absolutely are important. But to achieve the scale of improvement that Eileen Munro identified we need, we must build a whole system that creates the space for excellent social work practice to flourish.</p>

<p>That’s the ambition that we set out in ‘Putting Children First’ – taking action across the whole system to transform social work practice. An ambition that I’m determined to deliver on – building on the hard work of my predecessors and working with you as leaders across the country. And of course I have to pay tribute to Graham Archer and my team who I have to say, coming from the private sector, are phenomenal human beings.</p>

<p>If we want dynamic social work where excellent practitioners can reach their potential then we have to build a permissive, creative and supportive environment in which social workers have the confidence and freedom to develop and test new ways of working.</p>

<p>That is exactly what the Children’s Social Care Innovation Programme was set up to do – providing funding and support as well as the ‘licence’ to test different ways of working. And helping to build a system that is open to innovation and that learns from best practice as well as from when things go wrong.</p>

<p>Through the Innovation Programme we have invested almost £200m in 95 projects. Some of these projects are rethinking the whole of a children’s social care system in a local authority. Others are redesigning support for young people around a single trusted person. And others still are adopting and adapting from elsewhere new ways of supporting foster parents.</p>

<p>Many of those projects are already having a positive impact on systems, practice and, most importantly, on outcomes for children. You will have the opportunity to hear from many of those today.</p>

<p>But to give just one example - the first ever project funded through the Innovation Programme was ‘Focus on Practice’ which aimed to completely redesign the Triborough’s entire children’s social care system so that professionals could spend more time with children and families, and so that practice was rooted in greater expertise and evidence. The project has already started to show positive results including Ofsted finding that Focus on Practice was making an effective contribution to practice. The independent evaluation found that, as well as reductions in placements costs, staff absence and use of agency staff had also reduced, indicating improved staff wellbeing.</p>

<p>And Triborough has now set up the Centre for Systemic Social Work to share their learning and enable other authorities to embed systemic practice, improving services and outcomes for children.</p>

<p>With the Innovation Programme we set out to support genuine innovation to catalyse a real step change in practice.</p>

<p>And I’m delighted to announce today three new innovation projects supported by the Programme. We are investing up to £5m in Social Impact Bonds to support care leavers as they transition to adulthood and independent living in Sheffield, Bristol and in Lewisham. These Social Impact Bonds are a first for the Innovation Programme and a first for care leavers – testing new commissioning and funding models to support care leavers in to education, training and employment.</p>

<p>I’m also pleased to announce that Spectra First will deliver the Care Leaver Covenant on behalf of the Department. The Care Leaver Covenant is a fantastic opportunity for organisations in civil society to sign up to helping care leavers get the practical support other young people get from their families when starting out in life and becoming more independent.  That means helping them in a range of practical ways.  It could be helping them access and benefit from education, employment and training opportunities, for instance by offering apprenticeships, making sure they’ve got a set of interview clothes so they feel confident when they walk through the door, or providing discounted and free offers such as gym membership that helps combat social isolation and loneliness.  The Covenant is a way of making that happen and getting a wide range of organisations involved providing care leavers with the chances they need and deserve.</p>

<p>We know the difference that local authorities at their best can make to the lives of care leavers and the work Mark Riddell did in Trafford before being appointed the Department’s national adviser for care leavers is testament to that.  I know from my conversations with Mark that together we could do so much more to help care leavers raise and achieve their aspirations. So I very much look forward to seeing the exciting possibilities that I know all those Covenant pledges will bring.</p>

<p>Now I don’t underestimate the impact that individual innovation projects have had on systems, practice and on outcomes for children.</p>

<p>But the collective impact of the Innovation Programme is arguably even more important – the potential it has to build our understanding of what works in supporting vulnerable children and in driving improvement across the whole system.</p>

<p>Robust, independent evaluation is critical to building the evidence base of what works. I hope you have seen the 57 individual project evaluations that we have published to date, as well as thematic reports, and an overarching evaluation report? Huge thanks to Professor Judy Sebba and her team at the Rees Centre at Oxford University for their work coordinating the evaluations.</p>

<p>Understanding and learning from what works isn’t enough, though. It’s a bit of a cliché to say that we learn most from failing. But like most clichés, it is essentially true. Learning from when things go wrong is just as important – and we must make sure that the system as a whole learns from when things go wrong.</p>

<p>That is why we are committed to strengthening arrangements for learning from the cases involving the serious harm of children to swiftly inform child safeguarding policy and practice at all levels.</p>

<p>We are in the process of setting up a new independent Child Safeguarding Practice Review Panel and hope to be able to announce the chair and members very soon.</p>

<p>This first National Learning Conference is an important part of sharing the learning from the Innovation Programme. And I hope it won’t be the last opportunity to share learning nationally, both from the Innovation Programme and of course more broadly.</p>

<p>I’m delighted that we are working with innovation experts from Nesta, SCIE [sky], and FutureGov, as well as expert researchers from Cardiff University to establish a new What Works Centre for Children’s Social Care.</p>

<p>The What Works Centre’s focus is to improve outcomes for children and their families by developing a powerful evidence base, and supporting its translation into better practice on the ground. It aims to identify the most effective interventions and practice systems and support their implementation by practitioners and decision makers.</p>

<p>It will join the world’s first network of What Works Centres, which support policy makers, practitioners and commissioners to make decisions based on strong evidence of what works.</p>

<p>I’m really excited about the potential here to make a real difference to establishing a credible, trusted voice on what works in children’s social care that is integral to social work practice and development.</p>

<p>The What Works Centre will only reach that potential though, if it is delivering what you as leaders and practitioners in children’s social care need in a way that is accessible and practical. And to do that they need to hear from you and to work with you.</p>

<p>I know the What Works Centre team have spent much of the last few months talking to you to understand what you need and how they can work with you to fill the gaps that are there.</p>

<p>I would encourage you to continue to talk to them, to challenge them, and to support them. They are here to work with you, to make your work easier and support you to do the best for the children you work with.</p>

<p>That’s probably enough from me. Today is really about you going out and learning from the experts - each other. You are the experts. I look forward to meeting you and discussing ideas with you over the course of today and the coming months.</p>

<p>Enjoy the rest of the day - thank you for being here and for the work you do for our children.</p>

National Learning Conference
Minister for Children and Families Nadhim Zahawi addresses social work professionals from across the country.

Department for Education and Nadhim Zahawi MP
Delivered on: 
27 February 2018 (Transcript of the speech, exactly as it was delivered)

But the collective impact of the Innovation Programme is arguably even more important – the potential it has to build our understanding of what works in supporting vulnerable children and in driving improvement across the whole system.
Robust, independent evaluation is critical to building the evidence base of what works. I hope you have seen the 57 individual project evaluations that we have published to date, as well as thematic reports, and an overarching evaluation report? Huge thanks to Professor Judy Sebba and her team at the Rees Centre at Oxford University for their work coordinating the evaluations.
Understanding and learning from what works isn’t enough, though. It’s a bit of a cliché to say that we learn most from failing. But like most clichés, it is essentially true. Learning from when things go wrong is just as important – and we must make sure that the system as a whole learns from when things go wrong.
That is why we are committed to strengthening arrangements for learning from the cases involving the serious harm of children to swiftly inform child safeguarding policy and practice at all levels.
We are in the process of setting up a new independent Child Safeguarding Practice Review Panel and hope to be able to announce the chair and members very soon.
This first National Learning Conference is an important part of sharing the learning from the Innovation Programme. And I hope it won’t be the last opportunity to share learning nationally, both from the Innovation Programme and of course more broadly.
I’m delighted that we are working with innovation experts from Nesta, SCIE [sky], and FutureGov, as well as expert researchers from Cardiff University to establish a new What Works Centre for Children’s Social Care.
The What Works Centre’s focus is to improve outcomes for children and their families by developing a powerful evidence base, and supporting its translation into better practice on the ground. It aims to identify the most effective interventions and practice systems and support their implementation by practitioners and decision makers.
It will join the world’s first network of What Works Centres, which support policy makers, practitioners and commissioners to make decisions based on strong evidence of what works.
I’m really excited about the potential here to make a real difference to establishing a credible, trusted voice on what works in children’s social care that is integral to social work practice and development.
The What Works Centre will only reach that potential though, if it is delivering what you as leaders and practitioners in children’s social care need in a way that is accessible and practical. And to do that they need to hear from you and to work with you.
I know the What Works Centre team have spent much of the last few months talking to you to understand what you need and how they can work with you to fill the gaps that are there.
I would encourage you to continue to talk to them, to challenge them, and to support them. They are here to work with you, to make your work easier and support you to do the best for the children you work with.
That’s probably enough from me. Today is really about you going out and learning from the experts - each other. You are the experts. I look forward to meeting you and discussing ideas with you over the course of today and the coming months.
Enjoy the rest of the day - thank you for being here and for the work you do for our children.

<p>Minister for Asia and the Pacific, Mark Field, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I thank the hon. Gentleman for his question. Like him, I am deeply disappointed that the Government of Burma have not granted visas for members of the International Development Committee. That displeasure has been communicated to the Burmese authorities. The Committee does vital work, providing oversight of UK aid programming in Burma and beyond.</p>

  <p>The hon. Gentleman, who is the Chair of the International Development Committee, was due to travel on 27 February, with the rest of the Committee due to travel on 28 February. When no decision on visas was received by early yesterday morning, the Committee understandably cancelled the Burma leg of its visit. I understand that the Committee will continue with the second element of its trip, namely to travel to Bangladesh to review the Department for International Development’s work there, including support for the Rohingya refugees displaced to Cox’s Bazar and the vicinity.</p>

  <p>My officials were informed this morning that the IDC’s visa applications had been formally denied. Burmese officials have indicated three reasons for the refusal: first, that there is an extended public holiday in Burma; secondly, that access to Rakhine state remains restricted for security reasons; and finally—I think the Chair of the IDC mentioned this in a press release yesterday evening—that they were unhappy that individual members of the IDC had signed a letter calling for the senior general of the Burmese army to be held to account for Burmese military behaviour in Rakhine.</p>

  <p>It is right that the House takes a close interest in this sort of crisis, and I know that all Members present will continue to do so. The Government fully support the work of the International Development Committee and have been active in supporting this visit. DFID Burma worked closely with the IDC to develop a comprehensive itinerary covering a range of projects in-country. The British ambassador to Burma, Andrew Patrick, and other FCO officials pressed repeatedly for visas to be approved, both in Burma and through the Burmese embassy in London. I myself spoke over the telephone to the Burmese ambassador yesterday morning to raise the status of the visas. That demonstrates just how seriously the FCO takes this matter, not least as a courtesy to the House. I understand that you, Mr Speaker, wrote to the Burmese ambassador, and that he intends to reply formally to set out the reasons for the refusal.</p>

  <p>Through DFID, the UK is one of the largest single donors to the refugee crisis in both Bangladesh and Burma. Our aid is making a big difference. The first tranche of UK funding is providing emergency food to some 174,000 people and safe water and hygiene to more than 138,000. Following a diphtheria outbreak in the refugee camps, we deployed the UK’s emergency medical team of more than 40 specialists to save lives.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">This decision to deny visas is highly regrettable and will prevent the Committee from seeing some of DFID’s work at first hand. However, this Government must and will remain committed to supporting Burma’s poorest and most vulnerable people. Working with DFID, we will ensure that the Committee has access to all the information it needs to scrutinise the programme in Burma effectively.</p>

<p>Following a 6-week consultation held last year, 3 options were presented to the public on plans to improve this busy commuter route. The proposals included junction improvements between junction 1 and 7 and additional lanes at points along the route.</p>

<p>The preferred route includes a number of improvements which aim to reduce the causes of congestion on the M621. This includes widening the carriageway at junction 2, closing junction 2a anti-clockwise and installing improved technology and signs along the route. The anti-clockwise carriageway at junction 3 will also be widened from 1 to 2 lanes and the way the lanes merge at junction 3 will also be changed to give priority to traffic on the main carriageway.</p>

<p>Highways England project manager Sarah Kearns said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is an exciting scheme and we look forward to moving this project to the next stage and improving the road for drivers heading into and out of Leeds.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">The option we have chosen to take forward will work well alongside the other transport and infrastructure projects taking place around the city.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Highways England is currently carrying out improvements between junction 3 and junction 6 on the M621 until May 2018 as part of vital work which needs to take place before we begin work on this major scheme.</p>

<p>The works include the installation of central reserve concrete barrier for safety reasons and renewal of verge barriers and drains.</p>

<p>Education Secretary Damian Hinds heard first hand from pupils, teachers, apprentices and parents about the high quality education they were receiving during a visit to Nottingham (23 March).</p>

<p>The Secretary of State spent the morning meeting apprentices at Uniper Engineering Academy based at Ratcliffe Power Station, before CEO David Hughes provided a tour of the academy to observe lessons. Students explained why they chose an apprenticeship and what their ambitions for the future were. This was followed by a discussion with local Apprenticeship Ambassadors and businesses about how the Government can encourage more people to take up apprenticeships.</p>

<p>Education Secretary Damian Hinds said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">The high quality training I witnessed at Uniper today showed what quality apprenticeships can deliver. I want more people to choose the apprenticeship route and am determined that every apprentice, whatever their age, background or aspiration, has access to great training that will set them up for a successful career.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The next stop on the visit was Rosehill School, an outstanding LA-maintained special school in the East Midlands. Damian Hinds met members of the student council to hear about some of their creative projects and then listened to parents’ views on their children’s school experience.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State added:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">I’ve really been inspired by my visit to Rosehill School and the way the teachers work with the children to provide an excellent education with the deepest understanding of their additional needs. The happiness of the parents I met was a real testament to the quality of the education the hard-working teachers and staff provide.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">It’s a mark of a strong society how we treat children who are most in need of our support. Every child, no matter what challenges they face, should have access to a world-class education that prepares them for life in the modern world.</p>

<p>This follows an investigation that resulted in 5 Somerset estate agents being fined more than £370,000 last year for secretly agreeing between themselves the fees they charged.</p>

<p>Mr David Baker and Mr Julian Frost were, at the time, both directors of Abbott and Frost Estate Agents Ltd in Burnham-on-Sea. This was one of a group of estate agents who agreed to fix their minimum commission rates at 1.5%, so denying local home owners the chance of getting a better deal when selling their property.</p>

<p>As a result of its investigation, the Competition and Markets Authority (<abbr title=""Competition and Markets Authority"">CMA</abbr>) found that a number of directors were actively involved in the cartel or were aware of it and failed to take steps to stop it.</p>

<p>The <abbr title=""Competition and Markets Authority"">CMA</abbr> has secured legally binding undertakings from two of these directors – Mr Baker and Mr Frost – which have the effect of disqualifying them as directors and preventing them from being involved in the management of any UK company.</p>

<p>Mr Baker has been disqualified for 3.5 years, and Mr Frost has been disqualified for 3 years.</p>

<p>The <abbr title=""Competition and Markets Authority"">CMA</abbr> is continuing to investigate whether to seek the disqualification of other directors of companies involved in the fee-fixing agreement.</p>

<p>The <abbr title=""Competition and Markets Authority"">CMA</abbr> has the power to seek the disqualification of an individual from holding company directorships, under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986, where they have been director of a company which has breached competition law and their conduct makes them unfit to be a director.</p>

<p>This is the second time disqualifications have been secured in connection with a company’s breach of competition law, the previous case being in December 2016.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/people/michael-grenfell"">Michael Grenfell</a>, Executive Director for Enforcement at the <abbr title=""Competition and Markets Authority"">CMA</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Agreeing prices with competitors is one of the most serious ways a company can break competition law, as it harms individuals, businesses and the economy.</p>

  <p>When, as in this case, estate agents agreed among themselves commission fee rates, the effect is to stop people from shopping around for the best deal to help them with one of the biggest financial decisions any of us make – selling a house.</p>

  <p>Company directors have an important responsibility to ensure that their companies don’t engage in illegal anti-competitive practices.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">Today’s news should send a clear message to directors that if their companies breach competition law they risk personal disqualification.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notes to editors:</p>

<ol>
<li>
    <p>The disqualification undertakings are available on the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/residential-estate-agency-services-in-the-burnham-on-sea-area-director-disqualification""><abbr title=""Competition and Markets Authority"">CMA</abbr>’s case page</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 31 May 2017 the <abbr title=""Competition and Markets Authority"">CMA</abbr> imposed fines totalling £370,084 on 5 of the 6 agents involved- the 6th was granted immunity as part of a leniency agreement as they were the first to report the cartel to the <abbr title=""Competition and Markets Authority"">CMA</abbr>. More information on this investigation including details of the <abbr title=""Competition and Markets Authority"">CMA</abbr>’s full decision can be found on the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/residential-estate-agency-services-suspected-anti-competitive-arrangement-s"">case page</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <abbr title=""Competition and Markets Authority"">CMA</abbr> is the UK’s primary competition and consumer authority. It is an independent non-ministerial government department with responsibility for carrying out investigations into mergers, markets and the regulated industries and enforcing competition and consumer law</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986, the <abbr title=""Competition and Markets Authority"">CMA</abbr> has the power to apply to the court for an order disqualifying a director from holding company directorships or performing certain roles in relation to a company for a specified period if a company of which he or she is a director has breached competition law. The Act also allows the <abbr title=""Competition and Markets Authority"">CMA</abbr> to accept a disqualification undertaking from a director instead of bringing proceedings. A disqualification undertaking has the same legal effect as a disqualification order</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Competition Act 1998 prohibits agreements, practices and conduct that may have a damaging effect on competition in the UK. The Chapter I prohibition in the Act prohibits anti-competitive agreements and concerted practices between businesses (‘undertakings’) which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the UK. Any business found to have infringed the Competition Act 1998 can be fined up to 10% of its annual worldwide group turnover</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3 out of the 6 estate agents qualified for <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cartels-confess-and-apply-for-leniency"">leniency</a>, which means the <abbr title=""Competition and Markets Authority"">CMA</abbr> will not seek disqualification against their cooperating directors, as long as the estate agents continue to comply with the terms of their leniency agreements with the <abbr title=""Competition and Markets Authority"">CMA</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The disqualification of Mr David Baker takes effect from 11 April 2018 for a period of 3 years and 6 months and the disqualification of Mr Julian Frost takes effect from 24 April 2018 for a period of 3 years.  Mr Baker resigned as a director of Abbott and Frost on 31 January 2018</p>

Press release
Estate agent cartel directors disqualified
The CMA has secured the disqualification of two directors whose company broke competition law.
Published 10 April 2018
From:
Competition and Markets Authority
This follows an investigation that resulted in 5 Somerset estate agents being fined more than £370,000 last year for secretly agreeing between themselves the fees they charged.
Mr David Baker and Mr Julian Frost were, at the time, both directors of Abbott and Frost Estate Agents Ltd in Burnham-on-Sea. This was one of a group of estate agents who agreed to fix their minimum commission rates at 1.5%, so denying local home owners the chance of getting a better deal when selling their property.
As a result of its investigation, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found that a number of directors were actively involved in the cartel or were aware of it and failed to take steps to stop it.
The CMA has secured legally binding undertakings from two of these directors – Mr Baker and Mr Frost – which have the effect of disqualifying them as directors and preventing them from being involved in the management of any UK company.
Mr Baker has been disqualified for 3.5 years, and Mr Frost has been disqualified for 3 years.
The CMA is continuing to investigate whether to seek the disqualification of other directors of companies involved in the fee-fixing agreement.
The CMA has the power to seek the disqualification of an individual from holding company directorships, under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986, where they have been director of a company which has breached competition law and their conduct makes them unfit to be a director.
This is the second time disqualifications have been secured in connection with a company’s breach of competition law, the previous case being in December 2016.
Michael Grenfell, Executive Director for Enforcement at the CMA, said:
Agreeing prices with competitors is one of the most serious ways a company can break competition law, as it harms individuals, businesses and the economy.
When, as in this case, estate agents agreed among themselves commission fee rates, the effect is to stop people from shopping around for the best deal to help them with one of the biggest financial decisions any of us make – selling a house.
Company directors have an important responsibility to ensure that their companies don’t engage in illegal anti-competitive practices.
Today’s news should send a clear message to directors that if their companies breach competition law they risk personal disqualification.
Notes to editors:
The disqualification undertakings are available on the CMA’s case page
On 31 May 2017 the CMA imposed fines totalling £370,084 on 5 of the 6 agents involved- the 6th was granted immunity as part of a leniency agreement as they were the first to report the cartel to the CMA. More information on this investigation including details of the CMA’s full decision can be found on the case page
The CMA is the UK’s primary competition and consumer authority. It is an independent non-ministerial government department with responsibility for carrying out investigations into mergers, markets and the regulated industries and enforcing competition and consumer law
Under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986, the CMA has the power to apply to the court for an order disqualifying a director from holding company directorships or performing certain roles in relation to a company for a specified period if a company of which he or she is a director has breached competition law. The Act also allows the CMA to accept a disqualification undertaking from a director instead of bringing proceedings. A disqualification undertaking has the same legal effect as a disqualification order
The Competition Act 1998 prohibits agreements, practices and conduct that may have a damaging effect on competition in the UK. The Chapter I prohibition in the Act prohibits anti-competitive agreements and concerted practices between businesses (‘undertakings’) which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the UK. Any business found to have infringed the Competition Act 1998 can be fined up to 10% of its annual worldwide group turnover
3 out of the 6 estate agents qualified for leniency, which means the CMA will not seek disqualification against their cooperating directors, as long as the estate agents continue to comply with the terms of their leniency agreements with the CMA
The disqualification of Mr David Baker takes effect from 11 April 2018 for a period of 3 years and 6 months and the disqualification of Mr Julian Frost takes effect from 24 April 2018 for a period of 3 years.  Mr Baker resigned as a director of Abbott and Frost on 31 January 2018
Information for company directors about how to avoid cartel infringements is available in our 60 Second Summary and our short Risk guide

<p>UK Minister for Human Rights today announces 3 projects to support human rights across the Commonwealth, with particular focus on the South Pacific and small states. This £2.9 million work will support member states, regional organisations and human rights institutions in promoting human rights standards across the Commonwealth, with a focus on equality and adherence to international human rights obligations.</p>

<p>Lord (Tariq) Ahmad of Wimbledon announced a new £1.8 million project to help improve the capacity of Pacific Commonwealth countries to deliver human rights.</p>

<p>Lord (Tariq) Ahmad of Wimbledon said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Human rights are the bedrock of successful societies and a fundamental Commonwealth value. The Commonwealth is at its strongest when we share our expertise and experiences through our network.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">Smaller countries face significant challenges in establishing and maintaining their human rights institutions. This new funding will offer valuable support to our nine Pacific Commonwealth partners as they strive to strengthen their national institutions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The funding will support human rights institutions to meet international standards and help improve governance. Women, young people, persons with disabilities, and other minority groups will all benefit. The Pacific Commonwealth Equality Project will run over the 2 years that the UK is Chair in Office of the Commonwealth (2018 to 2020). The South Pacific countries are Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.</p>

<p>Lord Ahmad also announced £0.6 million to support the Commonwealth’s 31 small states. The Commonwealth small states grouping includes lower income countries and small island developing states (SIDS).</p>

<p>Head of the Commonwealth’s Human Rights Unit Karen McKenzie, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">The UK contribution will give impetus to the Commonwealth’s work with small states in Geneva, strengthening their voices in international human rights discourse. Ultimately, it will translate into better understanding and implementation of human rights promotion and protection for all citizens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lord Ahmad also announced £0.5 million funding to support the UK’s Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) as it takes over the role of the Chair of the Commonwealth Forum of National Human Rights Institutions (CFNHRI) for the next 2 years.</p>

UK announces £2.9m for human rights across the Commonwealth
Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon announces £2.9 million for human rights projects across the Commonwealth, with particular focus on the South Pacific and small states.
Published 16 April 2018
From:
Foreign & Commonwealth Office, Equality and Human Rights Commission, and Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon
UK Minister for Human Rights today announces 3 projects to support human rights across the Commonwealth, with particular focus on the South Pacific and small states. This £2.9 million work will support member states, regional organisations and human rights institutions in promoting human rights standards across the Commonwealth, with a focus on equality and adherence to international human rights obligations.
Lord (Tariq) Ahmad of Wimbledon announced a new £1.8 million project to help improve the capacity of Pacific Commonwealth countries to deliver human rights.
Lord (Tariq) Ahmad of Wimbledon said:
Human rights are the bedrock of successful societies and a fundamental Commonwealth value. The Commonwealth is at its strongest when we share our expertise and experiences through our network.
Smaller countries face significant challenges in establishing and maintaining their human rights institutions. This new funding will offer valuable support to our nine Pacific Commonwealth partners as they strive to strengthen their national institutions.
The funding will support human rights institutions to meet international standards and help improve governance. Women, young people, persons with disabilities, and other minority groups will all benefit. The Pacific Commonwealth Equality Project will run over the 2 years that the UK is Chair in Office of the Commonwealth (2018 to 2020). The South Pacific countries are Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.
Lord Ahmad also announced £0.6 million to support the Commonwealth’s 31 small states. The Commonwealth small states grouping includes lower income countries and small island developing states (SIDS).
Head of the Commonwealth’s Human Rights Unit Karen McKenzie, said:
The UK contribution will give impetus to the Commonwealth’s work with small states in Geneva, strengthening their voices in international human rights discourse. Ultimately, it will translate into better understanding and implementation of human rights promotion and protection for all citizens.
Lord Ahmad also announced £0.5 million funding to support the UK’s Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) as it takes over the role of the Chair of the Commonwealth Forum of National Human Rights Institutions (CFNHRI) for the next 2 years.

<p>Dr Fox announced that the Department for International Trade (DIT) is looking for an innovative, award-winning design concept for the UK’s pavilion at Expo 2020, which creates the most original, inspiring and memorable visitor experience possible.</p>

<p>The Expo 2020 theme will be ‘Connecting Minds, Creating the future’ with an expected footfall of 25 million visitors from around the world, providing an ideal platform to project Britain as a global force for prosperity, innovation, creativity and thought leadership. As this is the first World Expo to take place in the Middle East, the opportunities to connect with one of the most dynamic, young, and fastest growing regions in the world are immense.</p>

<p>The UK’s participation will consist of a self-build pavilion, supported by an accompanying programme of business and cultural events all related to the theme: Global Britain – Innovating for a Shared Future.</p>

<p>Britain has a proud tradition in supporting global expos, hosting the first ever Expo, The Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry at Crystal Palace in 1851, with previous winning entries at Shanghai 2010 and Milan 2015. This historic expertise was a key factor in British companies, including Foster and Partners and Grimshaw Architects, winning contracts worth £1 billion to help build and deliver Expo 2020 Dubai itself.</p>

<p>International Trade Secretary, Dr Liam Fox said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am delighted to announce that the UK will be participating in Expo 2020 Dubai which will offer UK businesses a fantastic opportunity to showcase the best of British innovation, over 150 years on from the Great Exhibition at the Crystal Palace, the world’s first ever expo.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">As an international economic department, DIT is ensuring British businesses make the most of growing markets and export their goods around the world. The festival will be a major showcase for the UK in the Middle East, and a shop window for the best of our creativity and innovation.</p>

International Trade Secretary urges UK business to show off the best of Britain at Expo 2020 Dubai
International Trade Secretary Liam Fox is urging innovative UK businesses to seize the opportunities at Expo 2020 Dubai. 
Published 18 April 2018
From:
Foreign & Commonwealth Office
UK Pavillion 2020 Dubai
Dr Fox announced that the Department for International Trade (DIT) is looking for an innovative, award-winning design concept for the UK’s pavilion at Expo 2020, which creates the most original, inspiring and memorable visitor experience possible.
The Expo 2020 theme will be ‘Connecting Minds, Creating the future’ with an expected footfall of 25 million visitors from around the world, providing an ideal platform to project Britain as a global force for prosperity, innovation, creativity and thought leadership. As this is the first World Expo to take place in the Middle East, the opportunities to connect with one of the most dynamic, young, and fastest growing regions in the world are immense.
The UK’s participation will consist of a self-build pavilion, supported by an accompanying programme of business and cultural events all related to the theme: Global Britain – Innovating for a Shared Future.
Britain has a proud tradition in supporting global expos, hosting the first ever Expo, The Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry at Crystal Palace in 1851, with previous winning entries at Shanghai 2010 and Milan 2015. This historic expertise was a key factor in British companies, including Foster and Partners and Grimshaw Architects, winning contracts worth £1 billion to help build and deliver Expo 2020 Dubai itself.
International Trade Secretary, Dr Liam Fox said:
I am delighted to announce that the UK will be participating in Expo 2020 Dubai which will offer UK businesses a fantastic opportunity to showcase the best of British innovation, over 150 years on from the Great Exhibition at the Crystal Palace, the world’s first ever expo.
As an international economic department, DIT is ensuring British businesses make the most of growing markets and export their goods around the world. The festival will be a major showcase for the UK in the Middle East, and a shop window for the best of our creativity and innovation.
Further information
Expo 2020 Dubai takes place between 20 October 2020 and 10 April 2021 and is based on the theme: Connecting Minds, Creating the future. This will be the first Expo to take place in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia region (MEASA). 180 nations will take part in Expo 2020 Dubai alongside NGOs and sponsors.
Six million visitors attended the Great Exhibition at Crystal Palace in 1851. This gave rise to the development of the area now known as ‘Albertopolis’ in London, which contains a large number of educational and cultural sites including the Natural History Museum, Royal Albert Hall and the V&A.
Companies have until the 24 April to apply to design the pavilion - applications should be made online
Companies interested in wider Expo supply opportunities should visit the Expo procurement portal for further information
DIT is holding a series of events across Britain for everyone interested in the design tender.
About Department for International Trade
The UK’s Department for International Trade (DIT) has overall responsibility for promoting UK trade across the world and attracting foreign investment to our economy. We are a specialised government body with responsibility for negotiating international trade policy, supporting business, as well as delivering an outward-looking trade diplomacy strategy.

      <div class=""govspeak"">
<p>Thank you Chair. The United Kingdom asked the Chair convene this meeting today to enable the Technical Secretariat to update us all on its technical assistance visit to the United Kingdom.  At the Executive Council in March I also promised to keep the Council informed of progress in our investigation into the use of a chemical weapon in Salisbury on 4 March 2018.</p>

<p>First, I really do want to express to the Director General my government’s gratitude for the support the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (<abbr title=""Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons"">OPCW</abbr>) has provided. The <abbr title=""Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons"">OPCW</abbr> responded promptly to our request to send their experts to the UK. They conducted a highly professional mission. The <abbr title=""Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons"">OPCW</abbr>’s Designated Laboratories have also responded professionally and promptly. What the Director General said was really important on this, and the Technical Secretariat’s presentation shows how professional that work was.   The report the Technical Secretariat presented to us on 11 April was thorough and methodical. The Secretariat responded quickly to our request to share that report with all States Parties. All have had the chance to see the quality of that work.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom is grateful for the many acts of support and solidarity from delegations in this room, and from organisations and governments around the world.</p>

<p>As you know, on 4 March Yulia and Sergei Skripal were poisoned in Salisbury, England, with a chemical weapon, which UK experts established to be a Novichok.  <abbr title=""Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons"">OPCW</abbr> has now clearly verified those findings. This is set out in paragraph 10 of the <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.opcw.org/fileadmin/OPCW/S_series/2018/en/s-1612-2018_e_.pdf"">unclassified Executive Summary</a>.</p>

<p>Before we talk about the report in detail, let me provide you with an update on events since we last briefed this Council on 4 April.</p>

<p>The Skripals were victims of a barbaric attack, and our top priority is their welfare. They have received the best possible care. We are glad to see improvements in both Yulia and Sergei Skripal’s health. Yulia Skripal was discharged from hospital on 9 April. Her medical progress is testimony to the outstanding care she was given by medical staff in Salisbury.</p>

<p>The welcome, gradual, recovery of the Skripals does not alter the core facts of the case. This was attempted murder using a military grade nerve agent on the streets of the United Kingdom.  The investigation now underway is one of the largest and most complex undertaken by British police. As a result of detailed forensic examination, detectives believe the Skripals first came into contact with the nerve agent at their home address.</p>

<p>My government announced on 17 April that <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/news/clean-up-work-underway-in-salisbury-in-next-phase-of-recovery"">decontamination work in Salisbury is starting</a> this week. It will take some months to complete. In total 9 sites, including 3 in the city centre, have been identified as requiring specialist decontamination. This will involve a complex process of testing; the removal of items which could be contaminated and that might harbour residual amounts of the agent; and chemical cleaning and retesting. All waste will be safely removed and incinerated. Each site will not be released until decontamination is complete.</p>

<p>Mr Chair, we promised to share the findings of the <abbr title=""Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons"">OPCW</abbr>’s Technical Assistance Visit with fellow States Parties. We asked the Technical Secretariat to circulate their report in full to all of you, without any redaction or amendment. The report that delegations here today have received is the same report that the United Kingdom received. It is a demonstrably professional, meticulous and scientifically sound piece of work.</p>

<p>Our technical experts have studied the <abbr title=""Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons"">OPCW</abbr>’s report in detail. I will briefly touch on some important elements:</p>

<ul>
<li>
    <p>firstly, the report sets out, in detail, the full forensic chain of custody over the collection, handling and transportation of the samples that <abbr title=""Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons"">OPCW</abbr> staff maintained throughout. This assures us of the integrity and validity of the results.  The Technical Secretariat went into some detail on this just now</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>secondly, the <abbr title=""Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons"">OPCW</abbr> used only their own equipment, so there could be no concern about contamination – accidental or deliberate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>thirdly, the environmental samples were analysed by 2 laboratories, and the biomedical samples by 2 separate laboratories. All 4 laboratories detected the presence of the nerve agent. And the findings show the stability of the toxic chemical, as the Technical Secretariat have just explained</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>finally, the report notes the absence of any significant amounts of impurities in the chemicals detected: “high purity” is the description in paragraph 11 of the unclassified Executive Summary, as the Technical Secretariat have just explained today. This suggests that a highly sophisticated laboratory made the chemicals</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Mr Chair, the <abbr title=""Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons"">OPCW</abbr>’s findings confirm the United Kingdom’s analysis of the identity of the toxic chemical. It supports our finding that a military grade nerve agent of a type known as Novichok was used in Salisbury. The Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DTSL), our laboratories at Porton Down established the highest concentrations of the agent were found on the handle of Mr Skripal’s front door.</p>

<p>But of course, while the identification of the nerve agent used is an essential piece of technical evidence in our investigation, neither DSTL’s analysis, nor the <abbr title=""Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons"">OPCW</abbr>’s report, identifies the country or laboratory of origin of the agent used in this attack. So let me also set out the wider picture, which leads the United Kingdom to assess that there is no plausible alternative explanation for what happened in Salisbury than Russian state responsibility.  We believe that only Russia had the technical means, operational experience, and the motive to target the Skripals.</p>

<p>Let me set out clearly why we have reached that conclusion:</p>

<h3 id=""first-technical-means"">First, technical means</h3>

<ul>
<li>
    <p>a combination of credible open-source reporting and intelligence shows that in the 1980s the Soviet Union developed a new class of ‘fourth generation’ nerve agents, known as Novichoks. The key institute responsible for this work was a branch of the State Institute for Organic Chemistry and Technology at Shikhany near Volgograd.  The codeword for the offensive chemical weapons programme (of which Novichoks were one part) was FOLIANT.  It is highly likely that Novichoks were developed to prevent detection by the West and to circumvent international chemical weapons controls. The Russian state has previously produced Novichoks and would still be capable of doing so today. Within the last decade, Russia has produced and stockpiled small quantities of Novichoks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Russia’s chemical weapons programme continued after the collapse of the Soviet Union. By 1993, when Russia signed the <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention/"">Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)</a>, it is likely that some Novichoks had passed acceptance testing, allowing their use by the Russian military. Russia’s CWC declaration failed to report any work on Novichoks. Russia further developed some Novichoks after ratifying the Convention. In the mid-2000s, President Putin was closely involved in the Russian chemical weapons programme. It is highly unlikely that any former Soviet republic (other than Russia) pursued an offensive chemical weapons programme after independence. It is unlikely that Novichoks could be made and deployed by non-state actors</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""second-operational-experience"">Second, operational experience</h3>

<ul>
<li>
    <p>Russia has a proven record of conducting state-sponsored assassination.  The <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-litvinenko-inquiry-report-into-the-death-of-alexander-litvinenko"">Owen Report</a> from the UK’s public inquiry into the death of Aleksandr Litvinenko concluded in January 2016 that he was deliberately poisoned with Polonium 210. It was said that there was a “strong probability” that the FSB had directed the operation, and that President Putin “probably approved it”. Commenting on other suspected assassinations between 2002 and 2006, Sir Robert Owen wrote: “These cases suggest that in the years prior to Mr Litvinenko’s death, the Russian state may have been involved in the assassination of Mr Putin’s critics” and that “the Russian state may have sponsored attacks against its opponents using poisons”. Since 2006, there have been numerous suspected Russian state-sponsored assassinations outside the former Soviet Union</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>during the 2000s, Russia commenced a programme to test means of delivering chemical warfare agents and to train personnel from special units in the use of these weapons. This programme subsequently included investigation of ways of delivering nerve agents, including by application to door handles. Within the last decade, Russia has produced and stockpiled small quantities of novichoks under the same programme</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""third-the-motive"">Third, the motive</h3>

<ul>
<li>Sergei Skripal was a former Russian military intelligence (GRU) officer, convicted of espionage in 2004. It is highly likely that the Russian intelligence services view at least some of its defectors as legitimate targets for assassination. We have information indicating Russian intelligence service interest in the Skripals, dating back at least as far as 2013, when email accounts belonging to Yulia Skripal were targeted by GRU cyber specialists</li>
</ul>
<p>Mr Chair, in the last 14 months, we have seen the use of chemical weapons in Syria, in Iraq, in Malaysia and now in the United Kingdom. This is a serious threat to the Convention. It is a threat to the rules based system, and therefore, a threat to every State Party. There is no place for chemical weapons use in the 21st century.  Not anywhere. And certainly not by a State Party to this Convention.</p>

<p>These actions demand a response. There is an urgent need to act, collectively, to reinforce the prohibition against the development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons. Those who choose to ignore these prohibitions, and use chemical weapons, should be identified and held to account – no matter who they are, or how long that may take. There can be no impunity.</p>

<p>Late on 13 April, the Russian Federation transmitted to the United Kingdom a list of questions under <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention/articles/article-ix-consultations-cooperation-and-fact-finding/"">Article IX of the Convention</a>. We will respond as soon as possible, within the 10 days stipulated in the Convention. We will share our response with all States Parties. Russia made a claim of urgency and requested an answer by ‘no later than 17 April’. We regret Russia did not consider it urgent when we asked them for an explanation on 12 March. We have still to receive a formal response to our questions.</p>

<p>Instead, Russia has shown disdain for international law and for the work of the <abbr title=""Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons"">OPCW</abbr>. Russia has staged a brazen disinformation campaign, and to attack the reputation and expertise of the <abbr title=""Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons"">OPCW</abbr>. They have sought to confuse, distract and brazenly misrepresent facts, despite the thorough, independent <abbr title=""Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons"">OPCW</abbr> report, in line with best <abbr title=""Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons"">OPCW</abbr> practice.</p>

<p>Before the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/statement-from-the-organisation-for-the-prohibition-of-chemical-weapons-on-the-salisbury-attack-4-april-2018"">Executive Council meeting on 4 April</a>, the Russian Embassy in London tweeted “Russia will accept results of the <abbr title=""Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons"">OPCW</abbr> Salisbury poisoning investigation only if Russian experts participate in it”. Most recently, Russia has suggested, erroneously, that the nerve agent identified was unstable and would quickly decompose, contrary to <abbr title=""Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons"">OPCW</abbr>’s finding and as you have all just heard.</p>

<p>Over the past weekend, Foreign Minister Lavrov said that Russia had somehow obtained information to suggest that the chemical used was identified by a world-leading laboratory as BZ. In fact, the 4 <abbr title=""Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons"">OPCW</abbr> designated laboratories did not detect BZ in any of the samples collected in Salisbury. The Technical Secretariat have been very clear on that point, and the Director General very clear in his statement.</p>

<p>In 2000, under the umbrella of Article IX of the Convention, the UK asked a number of questions of Russia bilaterally, with a view to clarifying issues relating to its CWC declarations. We noted that Russia, as the legal successor to the Soviet Union, accepted legal responsibility for the Soviet offensive programme. The UK specifically asked Russia about the development of Novichok agents and whether Russia planned to include relevant information in its declarations to the <abbr title=""Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons"">OPCW</abbr>. The Russian reply indicated Russia believed that there was no information which was required to be declared.</p>

<p>To date, Russia has proposed more than 30 contradictory and changing fantasies to explain the Salisbury attack. Russia’s actions to confuse and distract have not worked, but instead show how hard they are trying to hide the truth. We reiterate our call on Russia to meet its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention, to end its offensive chemical weapons programme and to declare its programme of Novichoks.</p>

<p>We will continue to call out Russia’s reckless and indiscriminate behaviour when it violates this Convention, and when it threatens global security.</p>

<p>Mr Chair, the United Kingdom will live up to our promise to keep this Council informed of all significant developments in our investigation. When the investigation and legal processes in the United Kingdom have completed, we will brief States Parties on the outcome.</p>

<p>I request that this statement is issued as an official document of this meeting of the Executive Council and placed on the <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.opcw.org/""><abbr title=""Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons"">OPCW</abbr> website</a>.</p>

Speech
OPCW Executive Council meeting: 18 April update on the use of a nerve agent in Salisbury
English

Русский
Update by Peter Wilson, UK Permanent Representative to the OPCW, following the OPCW Technical Secretariat's assistance to the UK after the Salisbury attack.
Published 18 April 2018
From:
Foreign & Commonwealth Office and Peter Wilson CMG
Delivered on: 
18 April 2018 (Transcript of the speech, exactly as it was delivered)
Thank you Chair. The United Kingdom asked the Chair convene this meeting today to enable the Technical Secretariat to update us all on its technical assistance visit to the United Kingdom.  At the Executive Council in March I also promised to keep the Council informed of progress in our investigation into the use of a chemical weapon in Salisbury on 4 March 2018.
First, I really do want to express to the Director General my government’s gratitude for the support the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has provided. The OPCW responded promptly to our request to send their experts to the UK. They conducted a highly professional mission. The OPCW’s Designated Laboratories have also responded professionally and promptly. What the Director General said was really important on this, and the Technical Secretariat’s presentation shows how professional that work was.   The report the Technical Secretariat presented to us on 11 April was thorough and methodical. The Secretariat responded quickly to our request to share that report with all States Parties. All have had the chance to see the quality of that work.
The United Kingdom is grateful for the many acts of support and solidarity from delegations in this room, and from organisations and governments around the world.
As you know, on 4 March Yulia and Sergei Skripal were poisoned in Salisbury, England, with a chemical weapon, which UK experts established to be a Novichok.  OPCW has now clearly verified those findings. This is set out in paragraph 10 of the unclassified Executive Summary.
Before we talk about the report in detail, let me provide you with an update on events since we last briefed this Council on 4 April.
The Skripals were victims of a barbaric attack, and our top priority is their welfare. They have received the best possible care. We are glad to see improvements in both Yulia and Sergei Skripal’s health. Yulia Skripal was discharged from hospital on 9 April. Her medical progress is testimony to the outstanding care she was given by medical staff in Salisbury.
The welcome, gradual, recovery of the Skripals does not alter the core facts of the case. This was attempted murder using a military grade nerve agent on the streets of the United Kingdom.  The investigation now underway is one of the largest and most complex undertaken by British police. As a result of detailed forensic examination, detectives believe the Skripals first came into contact with the nerve agent at their home address.
My government announced on 17 April that decontamination work in Salisbury is starting this week. It will take some months to complete. In total 9 sites, including 3 in the city centre, have been identified as requiring specialist decontamination. This will involve a complex process of testing; the removal of items which could be contaminated and that might harbour residual amounts of the agent; and chemical cleaning and retesting. All waste will be safely removed and incinerated. Each site will not be released until decontamination is complete.
Mr Chair, we promised to share the findings of the OPCW’s Technical Assistance Visit with fellow States Parties. We asked the Technical Secretariat to circulate their report in full to all of you, without any redaction or amendment. The report that delegations here today have received is the same report that the United Kingdom received. It is a demonstrably professional, meticulous and scientifically sound piece of work.
Our technical experts have studied the OPCW’s report in detail. I will briefly touch on some important elements:
firstly, the report sets out, in detail, the full forensic chain of custody over the collection, handling and transportation of the samples that OPCW staff maintained throughout. This assures us of the integrity and validity of the results.  The Technical Secretariat went into some detail on this just now
secondly, the OPCW used only their own equipment, so there could be no concern about contamination – accidental or deliberate
thirdly, the environmental samples were analysed by 2 laboratories, and the biomedical samples by 2 separate laboratories. All 4 laboratories detected the presence of the nerve agent. And the findings show the stability of the toxic chemical, as the Technical Secretariat have just explained
finally, the report notes the absence of any significant amounts of impurities in the chemicals detected: “high purity” is the description in paragraph 11 of the unclassified Executive Summary, as the Technical Secretariat have just explained today. This suggests that a highly sophisticated laboratory made the chemicals
Mr Chair, the OPCW’s findings confirm the United Kingdom’s analysis of the identity of the toxic chemical. It supports our finding that a military grade nerve agent of a type known as Novichok was used in Salisbury. The Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DTSL), our laboratories at Porton Down established the highest concentrations of the agent were found on the handle of Mr Skripal’s front door.
But of course, while the identification of the nerve agent used is an essential piece of technical evidence in our investigation, neither DSTL’s analysis, nor the OPCW’s report, identifies the country or laboratory of origin of the agent used in this attack. So let me also set out the wider picture, which leads the United Kingdom to assess that there is no plausible alternative explanation for what happened in Salisbury than Russian state responsibility.  We believe that only Russia had the technical means, operational experience, and the motive to target the Skripals.
Let me set out clearly why we have reached that conclusion:
First, technical means
a combination of credible open-source reporting and intelligence shows that in the 1980s the Soviet Union developed a new class of ‘fourth generation’ nerve agents, known as Novichoks. The key institute responsible for this work was a branch of the State Institute for Organic Chemistry and Technology at Shikhany near Volgograd.  The codeword for the offensive chemical weapons programme (of which Novichoks were one part) was FOLIANT.  It is highly likely that Novichoks were developed to prevent detection by the West and to circumvent international chemical weapons controls. The Russian state has previously produced Novichoks and would still be capable of doing so today. Within the last decade, Russia has produced and stockpiled small quantities of Novichoks
Russia’s chemical weapons programme continued after the collapse of the Soviet Union. By 1993, when Russia signed the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), it is likely that some Novichoks had passed acceptance testing, allowing their use by the Russian military. Russia’s CWC declaration failed to report any work on Novichoks. Russia further developed some Novichoks after ratifying the Convention. In the mid-2000s, President Putin was closely involved in the Russian chemical weapons programme. It is highly unlikely that any former Soviet republic (other than Russia) pursued an offensive chemical weapons programme after independence. It is unlikely that Novichoks could be made and deployed by non-state actors
Second, operational experience
Russia has a proven record of conducting state-sponsored assassination.  The Owen Report from the UK’s public inquiry into the death of Aleksandr Litvinenko concluded in January 2016 that he was deliberately poisoned with Polonium 210. It was said that there was a “strong probability” that the FSB had directed the operation, and that President Putin “probably approved it”. Commenting on other suspected assassinations between 2002 and 2006, Sir Robert Owen wrote: “These cases suggest that in the years prior to Mr Litvinenko’s death, the Russian state may have been involved in the assassination of Mr Putin’s critics” and that “the Russian state may have sponsored attacks against its opponents using poisons”. Since 2006, there have been numerous suspected Russian state-sponsored assassinations outside the former Soviet Union
during the 2000s, Russia commenced a programme to test means of delivering chemical warfare agents and to train personnel from special units in the use of these weapons. This programme subsequently included investigation of ways of delivering nerve agents, including by application to door handles. Within the last decade, Russia has produced and stockpiled small quantities of novichoks under the same programme
Third, the motive
Sergei Skripal was a former Russian military intelligence (GRU) officer, convicted of espionage in 2004. It is highly likely that the Russian intelligence services view at least some of its defectors as legitimate targets for assassination. We have information indicating Russian intelligence service interest in the Skripals, dating back at least as far as 2013, when email accounts belonging to Yulia Skripal were targeted by GRU cyber specialists
Mr Chair, in the last 14 months, we have seen the use of chemical weapons in Syria, in Iraq, in Malaysia and now in the United Kingdom. This is a serious threat to the Convention. It is a threat to the rules based system, and therefore, a threat to every State Party. There is no place for chemical weapons use in the 21st century.  Not anywhere. And certainly not by a State Party to this Convention.
These actions demand a response. There is an urgent need to act, collectively, to reinforce the prohibition against the development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons. Those who choose to ignore these prohibitions, and use chemical weapons, should be identified and held to account – no matter who they are, or how long that may take. There can be no impunity.
Late on 13 April, the Russian Federation transmitted to the United Kingdom a list of questions under Article IX of the Convention. We will respond as soon as possible, within the 10 days stipulated in the Convention. We will share our response with all States Parties. Russia made a claim of urgency and requested an answer by ‘no later than 17 April’. We regret Russia did not consider it urgent when we asked them for an explanation on 12 March. We have still to receive a formal response to our questions.
Instead, Russia has shown disdain for international law and for the work of the OPCW. Russia has staged a brazen disinformation campaign, and to attack the reputation and expertise of the OPCW. They have sought to confuse, distract and brazenly misrepresent facts, despite the thorough, independent OPCW report, in line with best OPCW practice.
Before the Executive Council meeting on 4 April, the Russian Embassy in London tweeted “Russia will accept results of the OPCW Salisbury poisoning investigation only if Russian experts participate in it”. Most recently, Russia has suggested, erroneously, that the nerve agent identified was unstable and would quickly decompose, contrary to OPCW’s finding and as you have all just heard.
Over the past weekend, Foreign Minister Lavrov said that Russia had somehow obtained information to suggest that the chemical used was identified by a world-leading laboratory as BZ. In fact, the 4 OPCW designated laboratories did not detect BZ in any of the samples collected in Salisbury. The Technical Secretariat have been very clear on that point, and the Director General very clear in his statement.
In 2000, under the umbrella of Article IX of the Convention, the UK asked a number of questions of Russia bilaterally, with a view to clarifying issues relating to its CWC declarations. We noted that Russia, as the legal successor to the Soviet Union, accepted legal responsibility for the Soviet offensive programme. The UK specifically asked Russia about the development of Novichok agents and whether Russia planned to include relevant information in its declarations to the OPCW. The Russian reply indicated Russia believed that there was no information which was required to be declared.
To date, Russia has proposed more than 30 contradictory and changing fantasies to explain the Salisbury attack. Russia’s actions to confuse and distract have not worked, but instead show how hard they are trying to hide the truth. We reiterate our call on Russia to meet its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention, to end its offensive chemical weapons programme and to declare its programme of Novichoks.
We will continue to call out Russia’s reckless and indiscriminate behaviour when it violates this Convention, and when it threatens global security.
Mr Chair, the United Kingdom will live up to our promise to keep this Council informed of all significant developments in our investigation. When the investigation and legal processes in the United Kingdom have completed, we will brief States Parties on the outcome.
I request that this statement is issued as an official document of this meeting of the Executive Council and placed on the OPCW website.

<p>The partnership is an extension of the successful ‘earn, learn and return’ scheme, which has already seen Indian nurses benefit from NHS work experience.</p>

<p>Registered nurses from Jamaica will undertake work placements in the UK, facilitated by Health Education England, in areas such as emergency medicine and intensive care. They will go back to Jamaica to share their new skills, knowledge and experience with their own healthcare system.</p>

<p>In return, NHS staff will be given the opportunity to travel to Jamaica to share their expertise with the Jamaican health service and help them to improve their care.</p>

<p>The aim of the scheme is to support the Jamaican government in improving the capability and capacity of their nursing workforce, as well as establish a network of professionals from both countries who will continue to share learning and knowledge beyond the scheme itself.</p>

<p>Minister of State for Health Stephen Barclay said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The NHS is blazing a trail in healthcare across the world and it is testament to the skills and expertise of our dedicated nurses that other countries are vying for their knowledge to help improve their own services.</p>

<p>This will also form part of the NHS’s commitment to supporting its staff to develop and progress their careers. Offering global health placements within training programmes or as part of continual professional development has shown to have a positive impact on recruitment and retention of staff.</p>

<p>All nurses who come to work for the NHS will be required to meet the standards of the Nursing and Midwifery Council.</p>

<p>The UK government also recently announced a 25% increase in UK nursing degree training places.</p>

<p>The government has passed its target to recruit an additional 2,500 prison officers by the end of 2018 7 months ahead of schedule, the Justice Secretary revealed today (22 April 2018).</p>

<p>As figures showed a net increase of 3,111 prison officers between October 2016 and March 2018, David Gauke said there would be no let up in the relentless recruitment drive despite the milestone being reached. Nearly 90 per cent of the 3,000 new recruits will be on the landings by the summer.</p>

<p>Continuing to boost staffing numbers is crucial as it will allow prisons to introduce a new model where prison officers spend more time both one-to-one and with small groups of prisoners. This approach is key to creating more constructive relationships between offenders and prison officers, reducing violence, improving stability and intensifying the focus on rehabilitation.</p>

<p>Justice Secretary David Gauke said:</p>

<blockquote>

Press release
Government hits target of 2,500 new prison officers 7 months ahead of schedule
The government has passed its target to recruit an additional 2,500 prison officers by the end of 2018.
Published 22 April 2018
From:
Ministry of Justice
The government has passed its target to recruit an additional 2,500 prison officers by the end of 2018 7 months ahead of schedule, the Justice Secretary revealed today (22 April 2018).
As figures showed a net increase of 3,111 prison officers between October 2016 and March 2018, David Gauke said there would be no let up in the relentless recruitment drive despite the milestone being reached. Nearly 90 per cent of the 3,000 new recruits will be on the landings by the summer.
Continuing to boost staffing numbers is crucial as it will allow prisons to introduce a new model where prison officers spend more time both one-to-one and with small groups of prisoners. This approach is key to creating more constructive relationships between offenders and prison officers, reducing violence, improving stability and intensifying the focus on rehabilitation.
Justice Secretary David Gauke said:
Going beyond this important milestone so early is a real achievement. It means the vast majority of these prison officers will be working on the landings by the summer, and all of them will be in place by the end of the year. This will make a real difference to the safety and security of our prisons, ensuring they can fulfil their purpose – protecting the public, reducing reoffending and crucially, rehabilitating offenders.
But let me be clear - the recruitment drive continues and will continue until we reach required levels across the prison estate, with the same urgency that has secured this remarkable influx of new staff.
Figures released today show an additional 2,699 prison officers on landings or in Prison Officer Entry Level Training (POELT) since October 2016, while a further 255 are performing operational support roles pending the start of their training.
Dean Gardiner, acting Governor at HMP Pentonville, said:
Hitting this target is an important milestone for the prison service. The new staff here at HMP Pentonville have made a real difference to how the prison runs by building positive relationships with prisoners.
The boost in officer numbers has allowed us to deliver more and improve the rehabilitation offered to the offenders, which prepares them to turn away from crime upon release and prevents future victims of reoffending.
HMP Cardiff’s Governor Danny Khan said:
Working in prisons is obviously challenging, but our prison officers are clear their job is about rehabilitating offenders, helping them secure employment upon release and making society safer.
It’s essential we recruit positive prison officers who aren’t afraid to push this agenda.
Officer Shrubsole, a neuroscience graduate, has just completed his training and started work at HMP Pentonville. The 25-year-old said:
I joined because I wanted a job where I could work with people and try to help rehabilitate them. I was also attracted to the idea that I could progress in this role in the future. I am really proud to work in the prison service – you’re working with such an important part of society.
Officer Zefi, aged 27, has completed 6 months as a prison officer at HMP Featherstone. He said:
I joined the service so that I could help rehabilitate people.
In the past 6 months, I feel that I have already made a difference which is really rewarding.
The work is varied - one day I could be escorting people to courts and the next supporting someone who is distressed or needs support.
We are clear about the purposes prison serves: protection, punishment and rehabilitation. Our staffing drive is vital to ensuring prisons will not only be safer, more secure and more decent, but will support prisoners in turning their backs on crime for good.
Increasing staffing levels is part of the wider prison reform programme, with its relentless focus on getting the basics right – ensuring prisons are safe and decent, with a secure perimeter that prevents drugs and other contraband getting in.

<p>Three men from the Plymouth area have been banned from the waste trade for fly-tipping in Cornish beauty spots.</p>

<p>Wayne Plummer, of Burrator Avenue, Princetown, Ashley Brown, of Tollox Place, Plymouth and Michael Baggally, of Wolseley Road, Plymouth, were all given Community Orders requiring 100 hours of work after admitting the illegal deposit of household, industrial and commercial waste and not being registered waste carriers.</p>

<p>They dumped waste, including old sofas and carpets, in scenic locations, even setting fire to it on one occasion.
All 3 were ordered to pay £520 compensation and given a Criminal Behaviour Order for 5 years, preventing them from being involved in the waste business.</p>

<p>Baggallay, who had his hearing for sentencing adjourned pending a mental health assessment to establish his fitness for work, appeared at Plymouth Magistrates Court on Monday 23 April 2018. Plummer and Brown were both sentenced on 10 April 2018.</p>

<p>The prosecution followed a joint investigation between the Environment Agency, which took the lead role, South Hams Council, Plymouth City Council, Cornwall Council and Devon and Cornwall Police.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the Environment Agency, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">This criminal behaviour was premeditated and planned and the environmentally-sensitive locations were chosen by the defendants for their remoteness in order to better escape detection.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A spokesperson for South Hams District Council, where some of the waste was tipped, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m delighted that we’ve been able to work with the Environment Agency and other local authorities to secure a conviction in this instance.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">I hope this sends a message that fly-tipping will absolutely not be tolerated, and we will prosecute offenders.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On 2 November 2016, Cornwall Council was alerted to fly-tipping in the car park at Cremyll on the Rame Peninsula that included sofas and carpets. Further offences followed in January 2017 at Little Lane in Bovisand and two days later near Torpoint.</p>

<p>The final offence happened at Hooe Road in Plymstock when waste was dumped on a public footpath and set on fire. Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue attended.</p>

<p>Evidence found at 3 sites linked the waste to all 3 men. The total clean-up cost was more than £5,000.</p>

<h3 id=""note-to-the-editor"">Note to the Editor:</h3>
<p>Businesses and members of the public have a duty of care to ensure that their waste is properly dealt with. They should always check that the company removing their waste is registered as a waste carrier and ask for evidence it will be properly dealt with.  Always ask for a receipt.  If a waste collection company can’t satisfy you on this, don’t employ them. These simple steps can stop fly-tippers in their tracks.</p>

Plymouth trio banned from waste trade for fly-tipping around Cornwall

Evidence found at 3 sites linked the waste to all 3 men. The total clean-up cost was more than £5,000.
Note to the Editor:
Businesses and members of the public have a duty of care to ensure that their waste is properly dealt with. They should always check that the company removing their waste is registered as a waste carrier and ask for evidence it will be properly dealt with.  Always ask for a receipt.  If a waste collection company can’t satisfy you on this, don’t employ them. These simple steps can stop fly-tippers in their tracks.

<p>Organisations are invited to run the first ever National Centre of Computing Education, the School Standards Minister Nick Gibb announced today.</p>

<p>The national centre, along with 40 leading schools across the country, will help improve teaching of the computing curriculum and is supported by a new programme which will train up to 8000 computing teachers on the latest digital skills – that is enough to ensure every secondary school in England has a teacher who can support pupils to succeed.</p>

<p>The digital sectors contributed £118 billion to the economy in 2015 and an estimated 1.2 million more people with specialist digital skills are needed by 2022. By ensuring the next generation has the technological skills we need we can help to maintain the UK’s position as a leading global digital economy.</p>

<p>This announcement comes as thousands of pupils prepare to sit reformed GCSEs in twenty subjects this year, including computer science. It follows last year’s successful introduction of reformed maths and English GCSEs, with 59.1 per cent of pupils achieving a grade 4 or above in these subjects. The new, gold-standard GCSEs are on a par with the best in the world and will help deliver the skilled workforce Britain’s industries need.</p>

<p>Standards are rising in schools thanks to these reforms and the hard work of teachers, which has resulted in 1.9 million more children in good or outstanding schools than 2010.</p>

<p>School Standards Minister Nick Gibb said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The fast-paced world of technology is constantly evolving and it is important that our computer science teachers are trained in the very latest digital skills.</p>

  <p>This programme will give teachers the subject knowledge and support they need to guide their pupils through the new computing curriculum. The knowledge pupils will gain in this subject at GCSE and A level will help employers to be able to recruit the skilled workforce they need, helping to build a Britain that is fit for the future.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">On Monday 14 May, pupils will start sitting the new computer science GCSE for the first time after working towards it since 2016. This qualification has replaced the ICT GCSE and now includes more challenging content, such as coding and computer programming. This is to ensure that pupils that take this GCSE are better prepared for further education, higher education and beyond.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today’s announcement follows on from the Autumn Budget, during which £84 million was committed to upskill computer science teachers. The National Centre of Computing Education will be a major part of this commitment, providing resources at primary and secondary level. Linked to this centre will be a national network of 40 school-led Computing Hubs where teachers will be able to access specialist training which will benefit pupils.</p>

<p>Some of the funding will also be used for an A- level support programme. This will set out to improve the quality of teaching in AS and A level computer science, and increase students’ knowledge and understanding so they are better prepared for further study and employment in digital and technology roles.</p>

<p>This announcement also looks to fulfil one of the aims of the Industrial Strategy, which is to invest in maths, digital and technical education and to help generate well paid, highly skilled jobs across the country. According to the government’s digital strategy, digital sectors contributed £118 billion to the economy in 2015 and exports of digital goods and services now amount to over £50 billion. Many jobs also now have a digital element, and it is predicted that within 20 years 90% of all jobs will require some element of digital skills.</p>

<p>Today sees the process of finding a supplier begin, and work on the National Centre is expected to start during autumn 2018, with the first training available in the 2018/19 academic year.</p>

Schools Minister announces boost to computer science teaching
Measures to give teachers the support they need to teach pupils skills such as coding, computer programming and cyber security announced today

<p>Hull residents and businesses are being invited to learn more about a multi-million scheme to protect thousands of properties from flooding from the Humber at two events this month (May).</p>

<p>They will be held at Mr Chu’s Chinese Restaurant in St Andrew’s Quay Retail Park on Tuesday 15th May and Victoria Dock Village Hall on Wednesday 16 May. Visitors can drop-in anytime between 1-7pm.</p>

<p>Representatives from the Environment Agency and contractors BMM JV
will be on hand to discuss plans for the £42million Humber Hull Frontage Improvement Scheme which will improve flood protection to 113,000 properties in Hull.</p>

<p>Following on from an event at the Guildhall last month, this will be a chance for people to discuss plans for these areas in more detail.</p>

<p>Led by the Environment Agency, the Humber Hull Frontage Improvements Scheme presents an opportunity to improve 7-8 kilometres of tidal flood defences at various sites along the Humber Estuary frontage to better protect homes and businesses that are at risk of flooding.</p>

<p>Subject to planning approval, work on the Humber Hull Frontage Improvements scheme will start in late summer and will be complete by the end of 2020.</p>

<p>Project contractor BMM JV – a joint venture between BAM Nuttall and Mott MacDonald – will be sharing early designs and plans which will build resilience along the city’s 19 kilometre waterfront.</p>

<p>Helen Tattersdale, project manager at the Environment Agency, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">These two drop-in sessions follow one we held at The Guildhall last month to share our plans. We want to make sure as many residents as possible are aware of what is being proposed and we’re keen to get feedback from them.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">Our team is ready to answer any queries residents of business owners may have about what work needs to be done to better protect the city from flooding from the Humber Estuary.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">In recent years we have seen the impact tidal flooding can cause and it is vital for the city to have improved flood defences to ensure devastating flooding like that which resulted from the  December 2013 tidal surge is few and far between.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Improvements in Hull will be supported by a further four kilometres (2.5 mile) of new and raised tidal defences on either side of the city in the East Riding of Yorkshire, at Hessle and Paull, delivered by East Riding of Yorkshire Council in partnership with the Environment Agency.</p>

<p>The Humber Hull Frontage Improvement Scheme is one of a number of tidal flood alleviation projects that form part of the Humber Flood Risk Management Strategy. The Environment Agency and local partners are now in the process of developing an advanced approach to managing flooding in tidal areas by the Humber for the next 100 years.</p>

<p>It will be a long-term investment that will contribute to securing the viability of Hull and the wider Humber region, ensuring it retains its place as the eastern gateway to the UK economy.</p>

Press release
Events to spread the word about Hull's £42m tidal flood scheme
People living in Hull are urged to find out more about plans to protect thousands of properties at two more events.
Published 11 May 2018
From:
Environment Agency and The Rt Hon Michael Gove MP
Hull residents and businesses are being invited to learn more about a multi-million scheme to protect thousands of properties from flooding from the Humber at two events this month (May).
They will be held at Mr Chu’s Chinese Restaurant in St Andrew’s Quay Retail Park on Tuesday 15th May and Victoria Dock Village Hall on Wednesday 16 May. Visitors can drop-in anytime between 1-7pm.
Representatives from the Environment Agency and contractors BMM JV
will be on hand to discuss plans for the £42million Humber Hull Frontage Improvement Scheme which will improve flood protection to 113,000 properties in Hull.
Following on from an event at the Guildhall last month, this will be a chance for people to discuss plans for these areas in more detail.
Led by the Environment Agency, the Humber Hull Frontage Improvements Scheme presents an opportunity to improve 7-8 kilometres of tidal flood defences at various sites along the Humber Estuary frontage to better protect homes and businesses that are at risk of flooding.
Subject to planning approval, work on the Humber Hull Frontage Improvements scheme will start in late summer and will be complete by the end of 2020.
Project contractor BMM JV – a joint venture between BAM Nuttall and Mott MacDonald – will be sharing early designs and plans which will build resilience along the city’s 19 kilometre waterfront.
Helen Tattersdale, project manager at the Environment Agency, said:
These two drop-in sessions follow one we held at The Guildhall last month to share our plans. We want to make sure as many residents as possible are aware of what is being proposed and we’re keen to get feedback from them.
Our team is ready to answer any queries residents of business owners may have about what work needs to be done to better protect the city from flooding from the Humber Estuary.
In recent years we have seen the impact tidal flooding can cause and it is vital for the city to have improved flood defences to ensure devastating flooding like that which resulted from the  December 2013 tidal surge is few and far between.
Improvements in Hull will be supported by a further four kilometres (2.5 mile) of new and raised tidal defences on either side of the city in the East Riding of Yorkshire, at Hessle and Paull, delivered by East Riding of Yorkshire Council in partnership with the Environment Agency.
The Humber Hull Frontage Improvement Scheme is one of a number of tidal flood alleviation projects that form part of the Humber Flood Risk Management Strategy. The Environment Agency and local partners are now in the process of developing an advanced approach to managing flooding in tidal areas by the Humber for the next 100 years.
It will be a long-term investment that will contribute to securing the viability of Hull and the wider Humber region, ensuring it retains its place as the eastern gateway to the UK economy.

<li>Alun Cairns issues clarion call to Wales’ business community as Welsh leg of search for airport logistics hub sites begins</li>
  <li>Six sites across Wales in the running to play a key part in delivery of proposed third runway construction, bringing jobs and economic boost to Wales</li>
</ul>
<p>The time has come to make opportunity happen for Wales and stake our claim on a multi-million pound supply chain for one of the most prestigious national infrastructure projects in a generation.</p>

<p>This will be the clarion call from the Secretary of State for Wales Alun Cairns during a keynote speech to an audience of Welsh business leaders vying to bring a Heathrow Logistics Hub to Wales (17 May).</p>

<p>Representatives from Heathrow Airport have arrived in north Wales to start the Welsh leg of the nationwide search for the final four selected locations which will pre-assemble components of the expanded airport.</p>

<p>Six Welsh sites are in the running to host a hub which will participate in the off-site construction of a new third runway.</p>

<p>The UK Government and Welsh Government will work together to ensure Wales plays a key part in the airport’s supply chain, enabling Britain’s new runway to deliver a legacy of construction excellence for the nation.</p>

<h3 id=""speaking-at-the-meeting-alongside-welsh-government-economy-secretary-ken-skates-welsh-secretary-alun-cairns-said"">Speaking at the meeting alongside Welsh Government Economy Secretary Ken Skates, Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m delighted that Heathrow has recognised the importance of involving the whole of the UK in its expansion plans with its effort to locate its logistics hubs across the nations.</p>

  <p>And while the focal point of construction will be in the south east, all the pieces of this great infrastructure jigsaw will be sourced from suppliers right across the country, making this a prime example of how UK Government backing for one national project in one location can spread wealth and prosperity far and wide.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">I’m determined that we showcase the very real opportunities to be had, now and in the future, by locating a hub on Welsh soil. Let’s make sure we start as we mean to go on today -  that we grasp this once in a generation opportunity for Wales, and that we exploit it to the full.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Heathrow expansion is a critical national infrastructure project for the UK that will rely on talent from across the country. Wales stands to benefit significantly with the creation of up to 8,400 new skilled jobs and £6.4bn generated from construction through to increased tourism and exports for Wales.</p>

<p>In addition to this, SMEs across Wales will also have the opportunity to attend one of <a rel=""external"" href=""http://www.heathrowbusinesssummit.co.uk/2018"">Heathrow’s Business Summits</a> in Cardiff on 11 July 2018.</p>

Press release
Welsh Secretary: Heathrow expansion can leave a world-class construction legacy for Wales
Alun Cairns to urge Heathrow to make Wales a destination of choice for its logistics hubs.
Published 17 May 2018
From:
Office of the Secretary of State for Wales
Alun Cairns issues clarion call to Wales’ business community as Welsh leg of search for airport logistics hub sites begins
Six sites across Wales in the running to play a key part in delivery of proposed third runway construction, bringing jobs and economic boost to Wales
The time has come to make opportunity happen for Wales and stake our claim on a multi-million pound supply chain for one of the most prestigious national infrastructure projects in a generation.
This will be the clarion call from the Secretary of State for Wales Alun Cairns during a keynote speech to an audience of Welsh business leaders vying to bring a Heathrow Logistics Hub to Wales (17 May).
Representatives from Heathrow Airport have arrived in north Wales to start the Welsh leg of the nationwide search for the final four selected locations which will pre-assemble components of the expanded airport.
Six Welsh sites are in the running to host a hub which will participate in the off-site construction of a new third runway.
The UK Government and Welsh Government will work together to ensure Wales plays a key part in the airport’s supply chain, enabling Britain’s new runway to deliver a legacy of construction excellence for the nation.
Speaking at the meeting alongside Welsh Government Economy Secretary Ken Skates, Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said:
I’m delighted that Heathrow has recognised the importance of involving the whole of the UK in its expansion plans with its effort to locate its logistics hubs across the nations.
And while the focal point of construction will be in the south east, all the pieces of this great infrastructure jigsaw will be sourced from suppliers right across the country, making this a prime example of how UK Government backing for one national project in one location can spread wealth and prosperity far and wide.
I’m determined that we showcase the very real opportunities to be had, now and in the future, by locating a hub on Welsh soil. Let’s make sure we start as we mean to go on today -  that we grasp this once in a generation opportunity for Wales, and that we exploit it to the full.
Heathrow expansion is a critical national infrastructure project for the UK that will rely on talent from across the country. Wales stands to benefit significantly with the creation of up to 8,400 new skilled jobs and £6.4bn generated from construction through to increased tourism and exports for Wales.
In addition to this, SMEs across Wales will also have the opportunity to attend one of Heathrow’s Business Summits in Cardiff on 11 July 2018.
These summits offer small business across the country the opportunity to become part of the many opportunities that Heathrow expansion will bring. On the day, Welsh SMEs will have the opportunity to connect and trade face-to-face with Heathrow’s supply chain, to forge new connections and win business with some of the UK’s largest organisations.
Alun Cairns added:
I have seen first-hand the diversity and expertise of our supply chain in Wales and I know how much enthusiasm there is for this project across the industry.
Yet out of the £1 billion maintenance spend year in year out at Heathrow, only 0.2% of Heathrow’s current procurement contracts come from Wales – we can and must do better than that.
I’ll be looking forward to meeting Welsh SMEs at the next Heathrow Business Summit in Cardiff in July where they can learn of the opportunities available to them when construction begins.

      <div class=""govspeak"">
<p>Speaking at the 21st annual Chemical Weapons Demilitarisation Conference in London, Defence Minister Lord Howe commended the vital work of scientific and technical experts to make the world safe from chemical weapons, while acknowledging the shocking events of the past year, including the use of a chemical weapon in Salisbury, and the continuing use of chemical weapons in Syria.</p>

<p>Defence Minister Lord Howe said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">In an increasingly dangerous world, we cannot allow these abhorrent weapons to spread once more across the globe. We are working with international partners across the world to agree how best to deal with the use of chemical weapons, and to ensure that those who use chemical weapons are held to account, however long this takes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The destruction of chemical weapons is a high priority under the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).  The Conference provided an opportunity for experts from all over the world to discuss their progress and co-operation in eliminating chemical weapons, and the technical challenges that remain.</p>

<p>Lord Howe highlighted the success of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), under the leadership of Director General Ahmet Üzümcü, in carrying out successful missions in Syria, in the most challenging operational circumstances in the history of the organisation. He noted also that over 96% of the world’s declared chemical weapon stocks had now been destroyed, as verified by inspectors of the Technical Secretariat.</p>

<p>Lord Howe said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">That’s a remarkable achievement in anyone’s book. No wonder that, under Ambassador Üzümcü’s exemplary leadership, the OPCW was rightly recognised by the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2015.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ambassador Ahmet Üzümcü, Director-General of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, said:</p>

<blockquote>

Chemical Weapons Demilitarisation Conference 2018
Defence minister calls for international community to hold to account those who use chemical weapons
Published 25 May 2018
From:
Ministry of Defence and Defence Science and Technology Laboratory
Old chemical munitions
Speaking at the 21st annual Chemical Weapons Demilitarisation Conference in London, Defence Minister Lord Howe commended the vital work of scientific and technical experts to make the world safe from chemical weapons, while acknowledging the shocking events of the past year, including the use of a chemical weapon in Salisbury, and the continuing use of chemical weapons in Syria.
Defence Minister Lord Howe said:
In an increasingly dangerous world, we cannot allow these abhorrent weapons to spread once more across the globe. We are working with international partners across the world to agree how best to deal with the use of chemical weapons, and to ensure that those who use chemical weapons are held to account, however long this takes.
The destruction of chemical weapons is a high priority under the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).  The Conference provided an opportunity for experts from all over the world to discuss their progress and co-operation in eliminating chemical weapons, and the technical challenges that remain.
Lord Howe highlighted the success of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), under the leadership of Director General Ahmet Üzümcü, in carrying out successful missions in Syria, in the most challenging operational circumstances in the history of the organisation. He noted also that over 96% of the world’s declared chemical weapon stocks had now been destroyed, as verified by inspectors of the Technical Secretariat.
Lord Howe said:
That’s a remarkable achievement in anyone’s book. No wonder that, under Ambassador Üzümcü’s exemplary leadership, the OPCW was rightly recognised by the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2015.
Ambassador Ahmet Üzümcü, Director-General of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, said:
We are now moving into the final phase of work to eliminate chemical weapon stockpiles, with over 96% of the world’s declared stockpiles now destroyed.
However, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons continues to face serious challenges in achieving its mission “for the sake of all mankind, to exclude completely the possibility of the use of chemical weapons”.
I welcome the important role that the Chemical Weapons Demilitarisation Conference continues to play in supporting international efforts to destroy chemical weapons, and contributing to our shared goal of a world free of chemical weapon threats.

<p>Today, Monday 4 June, the Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has brought together leading technology companies together with conservationists to develop new and innovative ways to combat the illegal wildlife trade.</p>

<p>Experts from companies including Google, Amazon Web Services, Cisco and Dimension Data, as well as umbrella body, TechUK and government technology experts from Catapult centres heard what challenges the conservation sector is facing as it combats the illegal wildlife trade, which is worth up to £17 billion a year globally, and is a highly organised, sophisticated criminal industry. The Minister for the Illegal Wildlife Trade, Mark Field, co-chaired the event.</p>

<p>This meeting is the first in a series that will take place throughout the summer in the run up to the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/london-conference-on-the-illegal-wildlife-trade-2018"">London 2018 Illegal Wildlife Trade Conference</a> in October. Further workshops will bring experts and conservationists together to deliver technological solutions to combat poaching, make it easier to identify illegal wildlife products at borders or to spot animals in danger in the field.</p>

<p>Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve just come back from the Amazon, one of Earth’s natural wonders, where both animals and people are suffering at the hands of criminals who are committing horrible wildlife crimes. What I saw has only sharpened my determination to combat the blight of the illegal wildlife trade.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">I want to make sure we’re using all the great talent we have available to us to fight this problem, so I’m calling on our finest technological brains to help us in the battle to save some of the world’s most endangered species.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TechUK’s CEO Julian David said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">Whether it is blockchain to support supply chain transparency and assurance or drones, satellites and the internet of things-enabled solutions to monitor activity in national parks and areas of high scientific interest, new tech is revolutionising conservation across the world. techUK and its members are excited to work with the FCO on a sector led approach to combating illegal wildlife crime.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Last month, the government published its Ivory Bill which, when passed, will be one of the toughest bans on ivory sales in the world.</p>

<p>As we move towards becoming a fully fledged environmental restoration company, World Environment Day gives us the opportunity to highlight the practical things we all can do to help.</p>

<p>Millions of us watched the unflinching pictures of the impact plastic waste is having on the world’s oceans in the BBC’s ‘Blue Planet II’.</p>

<p>Sir David Attenborough and team highlighted the avoidable waste and single-use plastic in our seas that is damaging the environment.</p>

<p>Calum Jack, graduate environmental advisor, Sellafield Ltd said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sight of a sperm whale trying to eat a plastic bucket is a devastating one and made me take a look at what I can do to make changes and reduce my plastic use.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">Simple things I’m doing are buying loose fruit and veg instead of packaged produce, using bars of soap and shampoo instead of those in plastic containers, putting my sandwiches in a Tupperware container instead of wrapping them in cling film, getting my milk delivered in reusable glass bottles as opposed to buying plastic bottles, no longer using disposable razors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the call is for us all to consider our impact on the environment for this year’s <a rel=""external"" href=""http://worldenvironmentday.global/"">World Environment Day (5 June)</a> and <a rel=""external"" href=""http://www.worldoceansday.org/"">World Ocean Day (8 June)</a> as the theme for 2018 is beating plastic pollution.</p>

<p>There are more than 10,000 employees working directly for Sellafield, thousands more as contractors and in our supply chain. Just each of us making a small difference could have a huge impact.</p>

<p>We have become over reliant on single-use or disposable plastic with severe environmental consequences.</p>

<p>Did you know?</p>

<ul>
<li>around the world 1 million plastic drinking bottles are purchased every minute</li>
  <li>500 billion disposable plastic bags are used worldwide every year</li>
  <li>50% of the plastic we use is single use</li>
</ul>
<p>World Oceans Day aims for us to work together to protect and conserve our shared oceans. The theme of plastic pollution continues:</p>

<ul>
<li>every year up to 13 million tons of plastic leak into our oceans</li>
  <li>the plastic that ends up in the oceans can circle the Earth four times in a single year and it can persist for up to 1,000 years before it fully disintegrates</li>
  <li>plastic also makes its way into our water supply and thus into our bodies.</li>
</ul>
<p>The challenge is on for us all to do something to help take care of the environment. It can be at a local, national or global level; and be a team effort or solo contribution.</p>

<p>What can you do?</p>

<p>Here are some ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li>reduce your use of single-use plastics: Refuse any single-use plastics that you don’t need such as bags, straws, cutlery, and cups. Instead take with you reusable versions of those products when possible.</li>
  <li>recycle: Use the recycling bins provided at work and the council provided recycling boxes to segregate and recycle waste at home</li>
  <li>participate: Consider helping with  organised litter picks or beach clean ups</li>
  <li>spread the word: Stay informed on environment issues and challenge others to be a part of the solution</li>

<p>Thank you for inviting me to speak here today.</p>

<p>I am proud to be the Minister for Digital, and to be part of a Government that is focused on digital, and supportive of innovation.</p>

<p>Our digital sectors are world-leading. Last year, venture capital investment in London’s tech sector reached an all time, attracting around £2.5 billion. If you add up the venture capital investment in Germany, France, Spain and Ireland, it would still be less than that in the UK. And with that money comes jobs – 3 million of them. We’re determined to protect and invest in these sectors, and to make sure they remain world-leading.</p>

<p>But this Government wants the benefits of digital to be felt across our whole economy, throughout society, and in every corner of the country. We believe every individual and every business should have the opportunities, skills and confidence needed to reap the benefits of digital technology.</p>

<p>And we are committed to ensuring that UK businesses lead the way in this era of global connectivity.</p>

<p>Last March we published the UK Digital Strategy. One of its main pillars was to help every British business become a digital business.</p>

<p>The evidence is clear that small and medium sized enterprises with a strong web presence, on average, grow more than twice as quickly as those with minimal - or worse, no - web presence. They export twice as much, and they create twice as many jobs.</p>

<p>So what can we do to support this ambition, and help business improve their digital capability?</p>

<p>Key to everything is infrastructure.</p>

<p>We are investing £1 billion of funding to improve the UK’s connectivity.</p>

<p>Almost 5 million additional homes and businesses now have superfast broadband available thanks to the Government’s investment in the Superfast Broadband Programme. There are limits to what we can invest governing by state aid. The £1.7bn+ Superfast Broadband programme reached 95% of premises in December 2017 – up from 45% in 2010. And we will continue supporting the delivery of superfast broadband beyond the 95% level, with at least a further 2% likely to be achieved before 2020.</p>

<p>But superfast broadband is the technology of today and we must be prepared for tomorrow. The future lies in full fibre and 5G.</p>

<p>That’s why, in his recent speech to The Confederation of British Industry, my colleague the Chancellor set a target of full-fibre connections being available to 15 million premises - so the majority of UK homes and businesses - by 2025.</p>

<p>We are fully committed to a full fibre Britain. And work is already underway.</p>

<p>In 2017 we launched the first wave of our Local Full Fibre Networks programme. The programme is designed to fund full fibre connections to businesses, local residents and public sector buildings across the UK, in order to stimulate commercial investment in fibre networks and accelerate full fibre rollout across the UK. It is part of the £740m National Productivity Investment Fund which supports the next generation of digital infrastructure.</p>

<p>To further stimulate this market, in March this year we launched our £67m Gigabit Broadband Voucher Scheme, whereby SMEs and their local communities can use gigabit broadband vouchers - worth up to £3,000 for business and £500 for residents - to contribute to the installation cost of faster connections over gigabit-capable infrastructure.</p>

<p>We are committed to investing in the next generation of mobile technology, which promises ultra-fast connectivity and data capacity on a much larger scale than is currently available.</p>

<p>And at the heart of this work is my department’s 5G Testbeds and Trials Programme.</p>

<p>Through this, we will establish the right conditions for 5G to develop in the UK, so it can drive efficiency and productivity, and maximise the UK’s chances of being a world leader in 5G technology.</p>

<p>We’ve selected six 5G projects for funding as part of the first Phase of the 5G Programme. We worked closely with business, academia and local authorities, with support from leading multinationals, to select six highly innovative projects that can best test how 5G technology can boost productivity and performance. I look forward to seeing the results in due course. I visited one in Bristol last week that looks at the ‘connected city’ concept. And I will be visiting one in Surrey that is exploring how 5G can deliver benefits in healthcare, particularly for elderly people.</p>

<p>We have also launched our Urban Connected Communities project - a large-scale testbed that will use 5G connectivity to improve the quality of life in a major UK city, yet to be decided.</p>

<p>The Chancellor acknowledged that the targets we have set ourselves are ambitious. But we believe they can be achieved. And must be achieved if Britain is to enjoy an advantage in this transformative technology.</p>

<p>But as important as infrastructure is, it is only part of the solution.
Evidence suggests that one of the main barriers to digitisation within small and medium sized enterprises is a lack of the skills and knowledge needed to make the most of digital technology.</p>

<p>We are determined to address this.</p>

<p>So we have established the Digital Skills Partnership, or DSP, which I have the honour of co-chairing. The DSP brings together the private, public and charity sectors in a joint effort to help people increase their digital skills levels. That doesn’t only mean total novices - although it includes them - it also means helping the already skilled become highly skilled.</p>

<p>Up to now we have prioritised the delivery of Local DSPs. These local partnerships are better able to tailor digital skills training to the needs of local communities and economies.
But we are also looking at increasing the national coherence of digital skills provision. We are developing a framework to help people and organisations access the best digital skills training opportunities, while also helping providers avoid any duplication of efforts and to more easily upscale and innovate.</p>

<p>In addition, we have spent over £10m on funding the Future Digital Inclusion project run by the Good Things Foundation. This excellent project supports the delivery of basic digital skills to adults in England via 5,000 community centres. It aims to help at least one million people to develop basic online skills by March next year, and appears to be on course to hit that target.</p>

<p>From 2020, we will introduce fully-funded basic digital skills training for any adults lacking these vital skills. They will be able to take improved basic digital courses based on new national standards of what is needed to participate effectively in the labour market and day–to-day life. We will consult on these new standards in the autumn.</p>

<p>On top of all this, our corporate partners pledged 4 million free digital skills training opportunities, as part of the Digital Strategy, and I’m pleased to say that more than half that number - 2​.5​ million and rising - have already been delivered.</p>

<p>But all these measures - on infrastructure, on skills training - will only be effective if we can persuade people to take them up. Of course many business are keen to engage with the digital revolution but others are more reluctant to embrace change.</p>

<p>So how do we drive digital adoption?</p>

<p>In the Autumn Statement of 2016, we confirmed £13 million funding to support the creation of a Productivity Council, intended to drive engagement with business, and improve productivity across the economy through appropriate use of digital technologies.</p>

<p>We are now exploring whether there are new ways to galvanise the sector to tackle digital exclusion and also how we can best identify, pilot and scale innovative solutions.</p>

<p>As I said at the beginning, this Government is focused on digital, and on supporting innovation. We will do everything we can to turbocharge this sector, and position the UK firmly at the forefront of the digital revolution. By creating this level playing field, we will make sure that the most meritorious businesses succeed.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

Speech
Margot James - ‘Ensuring UK businesses lead the way in the era of global connectivity’
The keynote address by Margot James, Minister for Digital and the Creative Industries, at the Telegraph Leaders of Transformation conference.

From:
Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport and Margot James MP
Delivered on: 
6 June 2018 (Transcript of the speech, exactly as it was delivered)
Thank you for inviting me to speak here today.
I am proud to be the Minister for Digital, and to be part of a Government that is focused on digital, and supportive of innovation.
Our digital sectors are world-leading. Last year, venture capital investment in London’s tech sector reached an all time, attracting around £2.5 billion.

The programme is designed to fund full fibre connections to businesses, local residents and public sector buildings across the UK, in order to stimulate commercial investment in fibre networks and accelerate full fibre rollout across the UK. It is part of the £740m National Productivity Investment Fund which supports the next generation of digital infrastructure.
To further stimulate this market, in March this year we launched our £67m Gigabit Broadband Voucher Scheme, whereby SMEs and their local communities can use gigabit broadband vouchers - worth up to £3,000 for business and £500 for residents - to contribute to the installation cost of faster connections over gigabit-capable infrastructure.
We are committed to investing in the next generation of mobile technology, which promises ultra-fast connectivity and data capacity on a much larger scale than is currently available.
And at the heart of this work is my department’s 5G Testbeds and Trials Programme.
Through this, we will establish the right conditions for 5G to develop in the UK, so it can drive efficiency and productivity, and maximise the UK’s chances of being a world leader in 5G technology.
We’ve selected six 5G projects for funding as part of the first Phase of the 5G Programme. We worked closely with business, academia and local authorities, with support from leading multinationals, to select six highly innovative projects that can best test how 5G technology can boost productivity and performance. I look forward to seeing the results in due course. I visited one in Bristol last week that looks at the ‘connected city’ concept. And I will be visiting one in Surrey that is exploring how 5G can deliver benefits in healthcare, particularly for elderly people.
We have also launched our Urban Connected Communities project - a large-scale testbed that will use 5G connectivity to improve the quality of life in a major UK city, yet to be decided.
The Chancellor acknowledged that the targets we have set ourselves are ambitious. But we believe they can be achieved. And must be achieved if Britain is to enjoy an advantage in this transformative technology.
But as important as infrastructure is, it is only part of the solution.
Evidence suggests that one of the main barriers to digitisation within small and medium sized enterprises is a lack of the skills and knowledge needed to make the most of digital technology.
We are determined to address this.
So we have established the Digital Skills Partnership, or DSP, which I have the honour of co-chairing. The DSP brings together the private, public and charity sectors in a joint effort to help people increase their digital skills levels. That doesn’t only mean total novices - although it includes them - it also means helping the already skilled become highly skilled.
Up to now we have prioritised the delivery of Local DSPs. These local partnerships are better able to tailor digital skills training to the needs of local communities and economies.
But we are also looking at increasing the national coherence of digital skills provision. We are developing a framework to help people and organisations access the best digital skills training opportunities, while also helping providers avoid any duplication of efforts and to more easily upscale and innovate.
In addition, we have spent over £10m on funding the Future Digital Inclusion project run by the Good Things Foundation. This excellent project supports the delivery of basic digital skills to adults in England via 5,000 community centres. It aims to help at least one million people to develop basic online skills by March next year, and appears to be on course to hit that target.
From 2020, we will introduce fully-funded basic digital skills training for any adults lacking these vital skills. They will be able to take improved basic digital courses based on new national standards of what is needed to participate effectively in the labour market and day–to-day life. We will consult on these new standards in the autumn.
On top of all this, our corporate partners pledged 4 million free digital skills training opportunities, as part of the Digital Strategy, and I’m pleased to say that more than half that number - 2​.5​ million and rising - have already been delivered.
But all these measures - on infrastructure, on skills training - will only be effective if we can persuade people to take them up. Of course many business are keen to engage with the digital revolution but others are more reluctant to embrace change.
So how do we drive digital adoption?
In the Autumn Statement of 2016, we confirmed £13 million funding to support the creation of a Productivity Council, intended to drive engagement with business, and improve productivity across the economy through appropriate use of digital technologies.
We are now exploring whether there are new ways to galvanise the sector to tackle digital exclusion and also how we can best identify, pilot and scale innovative solutions.
As I said at the beginning, this Government is focused on digital, and on supporting innovation. We will do everything we can to turbocharge this sector, and position the UK firmly at the forefront of the digital revolution. By creating this level playing field, we will make sure that the most meritorious businesses succeed.
Thank you.

<p>Two young boys, aged 11 and 14, who were clinging to a rock in the sea at Hopeman East Beach near Elgin have been winched to safety in the nick of time by HM Coastguard’s search and rescue helicopter from Inverness.</p>

<p>A concerned member of the public rang 999 just after 5.45pm on 6 June to say there was one person in the water and one on the rocks in difficulty. HM Coastguard coordinated the rescue operation which also involved Burghead coastguard rescue team and Buckie lifeboat along with Moray inshore rescue organisation.</p>

<p>It is believed one of the children got into difficulty whilst swimming in the sea and made his way to the rocks.  His friend swam out to help him and stayed with him on the rocks as the tide quickly started to rise.
Once on scene, it took the precision and skill of the Inverness coastguard helicopter just under 3 minutes to swoop in and rescue the two children, taking them to the nearby beach.</p>

<p>Speaking after the incident Kaimes Beasley, duty controller for HM Coastguard said:  ‘This incident could easily have turned into a really tragic one.  One of the boys had already been washed off the rocks once and thankfully managed to clamber back on.  We think that it only would have taken another 15 minutes for the rock to be fully covered by the rising sea and the boys would have been in the water.  Remember if you see someone in trouble at sea or along the coast call 999 and ask for the coastguard.  Thankfully, this rescue ended well and the boys were reunited with their families safe and well, despite their frightening ordeal.’</p>

<p>The theme for this year’s campaign is ‘Raising the Bar’.</p>

<p>We are proud to have hundreds of female engineers at Sellafield and in the supply chain – working on a nationally important mission to reduce the UK’s nuclear hazard</p>

<p>We also have the highest female apprentice intake of any STEM employer in the UK – at 41%, so we’re moving in the right direction.</p>

<p>Thousands of people will be proudly holding a ‘selfie card’ to show solidarity for equality, diversity and inclusion within the engineering profession.</p>

<p>The new Women in Nuclear (WiN) Cumbria branch has been running the campaign, and has the support of Sellafield Ltd, local MPs and other businesses across the county.</p>

<p>Chair of WiN Cumbria, Claire Gallery-Strong, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is such an historic year for gender issues, with the suffrage centenary, the gender pay gap debate and the #MeToo movement in Hollywood, there has never been a more relevant time for people to come together in solidarity for gender balance.</p>

  <p>This is not about one organisation or one individual, change can only happen as a collective effort.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">The #INWED18 campaign is a great chance to showcase the inspirational role models we have, from female engineering apprentices to senior female engineering leaders.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The campaign has been supported by MPs Sue Hayman andTrudy Harrison, aswell as employees from the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, Sellafield Ltd and other companies throughout Cumbria and Warrington..</p>

<p>Members of Britain’s Energy Coast Business Cluster (BECBC) were keen to get on board and arranged a photo opportunity at their most recent member meeting.</p>

<p>BECBC Board Chairman, Ivan Baldwin said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Inclusion is important to the Business Cluster and our members , on many levels, so we were keen to get involved with this campaign and to help in promoting Women in Engineering to our members too.</p>

  <p>We’ll continue to be an active ambassador for equality and diversity in the region whether that’s through the gender balance of our elected Board or the appointment  of a Shadow Board of younger people from our sector.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">To get involved you can print off your selfie cards at www.inwed.org.uk/selfiecards and share them using the hashtag #INWED18.</p>

News story
Raising the bar for women in engineering
Sellafield Ltd is supporting this years campaign for International Women in Engineering Day (23 June.)
Published 20 June 2018
From:
Sellafield Ltd
People from Sellafield and the supply chain are supporting International Women in Engineering Day
The theme for this year’s campaign is ‘Raising the Bar’.
We are proud to have hundreds of female engineers at Sellafield and in the supply chain – working on a nationally important mission to reduce the UK’s nuclear hazard
We also have the highest female apprentice intake of any STEM employer in the UK – at 41%, so we’re moving in the right direction.
Thousands of people will be proudly holding a ‘selfie card’ to show solidarity for equality, diversity and inclusion within the engineering profession.
The new Women in Nuclear (WiN) Cumbria branch has been running the campaign, and has the support of Sellafield Ltd, local MPs and other businesses across the county.
Chair of WiN Cumbria, Claire Gallery-Strong, said:
This is such an historic year for gender issues, with the suffrage centenary, the gender pay gap debate and the #MeToo movement in Hollywood, there has never been a more relevant time for people to come together in solidarity for gender balance.
This is not about one organisation or one individual, change can only happen as a collective effort.
The #INWED18 campaign is a great chance to showcase the inspirational role models we have, from female engineering apprentices to senior female engineering leaders.
The campaign has been supported by MPs Sue Hayman andTrudy Harrison, aswell as employees from the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, Sellafield Ltd and other companies throughout Cumbria and Warrington..
Members of Britain’s Energy Coast Business Cluster (BECBC) were keen to get on board and arranged a photo opportunity at their most recent member meeting.
BECBC Board Chairman, Ivan Baldwin said:
Inclusion is important to the Business Cluster and our members , on many levels, so we were keen to get involved with this campaign and to help in promoting Women in Engineering to our members too.
We’ll continue to be an active ambassador for equality and diversity in the region whether that’s through the gender balance of our elected Board or the appointment  of a Shadow Board of younger people from our sector.
To get involved you can print off your selfie cards at www.inwed.org.uk/selfiecards and share them using the hashtag #INWED18.

<p>Thank you Mr President, and thank you to our briefers, particularly may I pass on my thanks to Special Representative Yamamoto for updating the Council on the latest report and for all of the work that you and your team are doing in challenging circumstances. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr President, this feels like a moment of opportunity for Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Recent events including the unprecedented ceasefires and the preparations for upcoming elections give us all reasons to be cautiously optimistic. We must do everything we can to make the most of this opportunity to end the violence.</p>

<p>President Ghani’s offer to the Taleban of talks without preconditions and the ceasefires over Eid al-Fitr are most welcome. The extraordinary images of soldiers and Taleban fighters embracing in the streets of cities across Afghanistan gave hope to millions of Afghans that an end to the conflict was achievable.</p>

<p>The Afghan Government has shown an impressive commitment to peace. Now we need a similar commitment from the Taleban.  The Taleban need to decide whether they want to be a part of the future of Afghanistan. It seems to be what many of their fighters want. It is what the Afghan people want. It is time for the Taleban’s leaders to show true courage and true leadership and work for peace.</p>

<p>Of course, the only solution to the conflict is an Afghan-led and owned political process.</p>

<p>Mr President, there are now four months to go until parliamentary elections in October. We welcome the progress to date on key electoral reforms and thank UNAMA for supporting the Afghan government in their preparations.</p>

<p>Boris Johnson, the British Foreign Secretary, was in Kabul only yesterday. And he said there that “we encourage UNAMA to keep up the pressure on the Afghan Government and its electoral management bodies to ensure credible, inclusive and timely elections.”</p>

<p>The UK and the wider donor community are also playing our parts, and we are encouraging the Independent Election Commission (IEC) and Electoral Complaints Commission (ECC) to deliver elections on time with a focus on reducing opportunities for fraud. We are particularly concerned that key positions remain unfilled at the IEC and we call on the Afghan Government to appoint a new CEO and the provincial ECC Commissioners without delay.</p>

<p>Following the elections, the Geneva Conference on Afghanistan in November will be an opportunity for donor countries and the Government of Afghanistan to take stock of progress since 2016 and to ensure the government is on track to deliver its reform commitments. This is also an opportunity for the donor community and the government to consider the future of international support beyond 2020.</p>

<p>Mr President, at this moment of potential change, we should reflect on progress to date, particularly on the rights of women and girls. This is a personal priority of the British Foreign Secretary, who met Afghan girls participating in a UK-funded sports education programme during his recent trip.  Over the last six years, UK aid has helped 300,000 marginalised Afghan girls into education and trained over 10,000 teachers.</p>

<p>But there is some way to go to reach our goal of 12 years of quality education for all girls. The UK is contributing almost $1 billion in development funding in Afghanistan between 2016 and 2020. We will continue to work closely with our Afghan partners to promote opportunities for all Afghans.</p>

<p>Mr President, I began by saying that this felt like a moment of opportunity for Afghanistan. There is a prospect of peace. Elections are coming, which can help support peace and social stability. Let us stand beside our Afghan partners at this moment. Let us stand beside the Afghan people as they determine their own future.</p>

<p>Thank you Mr President.</p>

Speech
A moment of opportunity for Afghanistan
Statement by Ambassador Jonathan Allen, UK Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN, at the Security Council debate on the situation in Afghanistan.
Published 26 June 2018
From:
Foreign & Commonwealth Office and Jonathan Allen
Delivered on: 
26 June 2018 (Transcript of the speech, exactly as it was delivered)
Thank you Mr President, and thank you to our briefers, particularly may I pass on my thanks to Special Representative Yamamoto for updating the Council on the latest report and for all of the work that you and your team are doing in challenging circumstances. Thank you.

      <div class=""govspeak"">
<p>Thank you very much for inviting me to address your Annual Monitoring Officers’ Conference.</p>

<p>I’m here to speak mainly about the Committee’s current review of local government ethical standards, which I’m sure many of you will be aware of.</p>

<p>But I think it would be helpful to begin by introducing the Committee on Standards in Public Life and its work to help set the context in which we work.</p>

<p>The Committee was established in 1994 by the then Prime Minister, John Major, to address concerns about declining standards in public life. This was at the time of cash for questions, and worries about the politicisation of public appointments and relationships between politicians and businesses.</p>

<p>The first Committee, chaired by Lord Nolan, was asked to:
“Examine current concerns about standards of conduct of all holders of public office, including arrangements relating to financial and commercial activities, and make recommendations as to any changes in present arrangements which might be required to ensure the highest standards of propriety in public life.”</p>

<p>The Committee’s First Report set out Seven Principles, often now called the Nolan Principles: Selflessness, Integrity, Objectivity, Accountability, Openness, Honesty and Leadership.</p>

<p>These have been accepted by the public and those in public life as the baseline standard for conduct in public life, and remain the cornerstone of the UK’s ethical landscape.</p>

<p>The Committee is independent, non-partisan and non-statutory. The Committee looks across public life at emerging or potential standards issues, and reports directly to the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>We don’t have any formal powers or sanctions, and we don’t investigate individual cases. Our influence and credibility is founded on rigorous reports based on the best available evidence, that make clear, well-argued recommendations.</p>

<h3 id=""history-of-the-committees-work"">History of the Committee’s work</h3>

<p>So, our work on local government. I’d like to spend a couple of minutes reviewing our past work and then consider some key themes that have emerged from our public consultation around the current system; the roles of Monitoring Officers and political parties; culture; and councillors’ behaviour in all this.</p>

<p>It’s fair to say that the Committee on Standards in Public Life has ‘form’ when it comes to local government standards.</p>

<p>The Committee’s Third Report, Standards of Conduct in Local Government in England, Scotland and Wales was published in 1997, and made a range of recommendations to improve ethical standards in local government.</p>

<p>These included introducing codes of conduct, public registers of interests, and rules on declaring interests. The Committee proposed that codes of conduct would be enforced by local standards committees with powers to suspend councillors, with national tribunals to hear appeals.</p>

<p>The government responded to the Committee’s report in 1998. Whilst the government agreed with a number of the Committee’s recommendations, they did not agree that local standards committees should have the primary responsibility for enforcing standards.</p>

<p>The government created the Standards Board for England, and the government issued a model code of conduct, which the Standards Board advised councils at the time not to supplement.</p>

<p>The Committee considered all these reforms in 2005. Its report criticised the centralised method for handling complaints and argued for substantial reform of the Standards Board. The government agreed, renaming the Standards Board, ‘Standards for England’ and changing its role and remit.</p>

<p>Our current inquiry is the first full review of local government that the Committee has undertaken since then.  The time feels right for us to look again and particularly in a environment where so much has changed.</p>

<h3 id=""a-new-context"">A new context</h3>

<p>Local government has always had responsibility for delivering significant public services, that citizens rely on day-in, day-out.</p>

<p>But it’s undeniable that councils are now involved in more outsourcing and commercial decision-making. They are also involved in more partnership working, for example, as part of Local Enterprise Partnerships.</p>

<p>This new environment creates new opportunities. But there are also potential risks: where lines of accountability are unclear, and where the best way of scrutinising complex arrangements hasn’t necessarily been established.</p>

<p>Those potential risks are heightened in an environment where there is diminished regulatory oversight of the sector, and where officers feel less able to challenge elected members. I’ll come back to that.</p>

<p>When it comes to the standards system, of course the Standards Board has been abolished, and responsibility for local standards has been given to local authorities.</p>

<p>I want to be clear that no-one during the course of our review has made a serious case for turning the clock back and returning to a centralised system.</p>

<p>Councils have told us that they value the flexibility of the current system, and the discretion to be able to resolve a issues informally.</p>

<p>What we are hearing from councils is that they want to be given the framework, tools and guidance to be able to maintain high standards in their own authority.</p>

<h3 id=""the-standards-framework"">The standards framework</h3>

<p>I want to spend some time now reflecting back some of the different views we’ve heard on the nuts and bolts of the current system.</p>

<p>Let me put some of you out of your misery and start with sanctions. We’ve heard loud and clear, in meetings, roundtables, and through our consultation: the current sanctions are not enough.</p>

<p>Monitoring Officers will know better than anyone else that without robust sanctions, councils can’t deal effectively with serious and persistent misconduct. This is the major gap in the current system.</p>

<p>As a Committee we’re going to be looking carefully at the evidence we’ve received, and the wider legal issues involved, as we consider what sanctions it would be appropriate for councils to have available.</p>

<p>When it comes to codes of conduct, we’ve been hearing that the variation in codes can be a problem for two groups in particular. First, dual- or triple-hatted councillors, who might have different requirements for registering or declaring interests, for example. And second, for principal authorities investigating breaches of parish codes.</p>

<p>Of course, some unitary authorities can have responsibility for 150 or 200 parishes, all of which - in principle - could have unique codes of conduct. But we’ve also seen that in some of these cases, town and parish councils have agreed a single, standard code.</p>

<p>Codes of conduct also vary in quality - with some codes relying on very broad provisions, which are difficult to adjudicate on and which can easily generate disputes over interpretation.</p>

<p>We’re going to be looking at best practice in this area and any guidance that could be given to councils when drawing up a code of conducts.</p>

<p>When it comes to declaring interests, we’ve heard that the current requirements don’t match the public’s expectations and don’t work for councillors either. Any system of declaring interests needs to have clarity for those who have to use it - so that you can know if you are keeping within the rules - and also needs to show that it’s protecting the public interest by preventing undue influence.</p>

<p>The Nolan Principle of integrity is clear, public office holders must avoid placing themselves under any obligation to people or organisations that might try inappropriately to influence them in their work, and need to declare and resolve any interests or relationships. The evidence we’ve received is that the current system could be tightened up and, at the same time, made clearer for councillors and officers.</p>

<p>Independent oversight is crucial to upholding the Nolan Principle of objectivity, the principle that decisions need to be taken impartially, fairly and on merit. Independent checks on the process make sure that those decisions are taken impartially and fairly - which is just as important for councillors as it is for complainants. We’ve heard a range of views on the role of standards committees and we’ll be looking carefully at that issue.</p>

<p>It’s also clear to us that the Independent Person plays a valuable role. At the moment, as you will know, it’s an entirely advisory role with no formal power. We’ve heard some encouraging cases of good practice in how local authorities use their Independent Person and the insight they can bring, and we’ll be carefully considering the case for strengthening that role and putting it on a more formal footing.</p>

<h3 id=""the-role-of-the-monitoring-officer"">The role of the Monitoring Officer</h3>

<p>Let me turn now to your role: Monitoring Officers.</p>

<p>Monitoring Officers really are the linchpin of the current system. As the Monitoring Officer, you have the overall responsibility for standards in a local authority.</p>

<p>But we know that Monitoring Officers need the support of the other senior and statutory officers in order to maintain ethical standards, and that those other senior officers need to recognise a joint and corporate responsibility for maintaining high standards in an authority.</p>

<p>We’ve been hearing about cases where Monitoring Officers face undue pressure in their role, or don’t feel able to challenge elected members.</p>

<p>In senior officer roles, there are undoubtedly going to be cross-pressures and potential conflicts of interest.</p>

<p>But we’ve heard that senior officers feel less secure than they have previously, and as a result, less empowered to speak out when they need to.</p>

<p>Local government has a tradition of propriety and carefully managing competing pressures. That tradition is extremely valuable and needs to be protected.</p>

<p>So we’re going to be looking at how Monitoring Officers can be protected from undue pressure, as well as the broader role of senior officers in maintaining the integrity of the standards system.</p>

<p>Monitoring Officers also play an important role in the interface between Principal Authorities and town and parish councils when it comes to standards, particularly investigating complaints about parish councillors.</p>

<p>That relationship can be a difficult one, or a very positive one. We’ve heard examples of good practice, and examples of when that relationship has not been as effective as it could be. We will be considering carefully all the evidence we’ve received on this issue, and if there are any recommendations that can be made.</p>

<h3 id=""political-groups"">Political groups</h3>

<p>Whilst Monitoring Officers and Standards Committees might be the visible face of the standards system, it’s become clear to us that political groups are an unseen but important influence on standards in local authorities.</p>

<p>After all, it is political groups that hold some of the most effective sanctions under the current regime, like removal from committees or the threat of having the whip withdrawn.</p>

<p>Of course, how political groups operate varies from council to council. Some councils will have a heavily partisan culture. Other councils will see political groups cooperating on a range of issues - including on ethical and conduct issues.</p>

<p>We’re gathering evidence at the moment on the workings of political groups, and the relationship between national parties and local parties, and we’ll be thinking carefully about their role in the standards framework.</p>

<h3 id=""culture"">Culture</h3>

<p>As Monitoring Officers, you will know that whatever codes of conduct or values statements say - important as they are - it’s ultimately the culture of an authority that determines how people will behave.</p>

<p>It might be a culture of secrecy, that resists being open to scrutiny and engaging with the public.</p>

<p>Or a culture that accepts bullying, where over time officers are expected just to be able to ‘cope with it’.</p>

<p>Or a highly charged partisan culture that sees everything through a political lense.</p>

<p>Or - perhaps - a culture focussed on the public interest, that is open and transparent, values evidence in decision-making, recognises and manages conflicts of interest, and challenges poor behaviour when it occurs.</p>

<p>People quickly learn ‘how things are done around here’ - and will usually fit in accordingly. It is hard to swim against the tide of a prevailing culture, for good or for ill.</p>

<p>So a driving question for us throughout our review has been ‘what shapes an ethical culture in local government’?</p>

<p>In many ways, it’s not a new question for us as a Committee.</p>

<p>The original Nolan Committee, besides framing the Seven Principles of Public Life, argued that there were three ‘common threads’ in inculcating the Seven Principles in organisations: Codes of Conduct; Independent Scrutiny; and Guidance and Education.</p>

<p>And in our report Ethics in Practice in 2014, the Committee looked at this issue head-on: how do you raise awareness and understanding of ethical issues? And how do you embed ethical standards in an organisation’s culture?</p>

<p>That report, as well as the Committee’s research since then, identified induction and training as the crucial elements, alongside leadership, in creating and sustaining an ethical culture.</p>

<p>Organisations need to learn from good practice, and consider ethical issues right from recruitment through to ongoing training, and see it as a fundamental aspect of leadership in the top levels of an organisation.</p>

<p>That might answer the question of culture in principle. But looking at local government, we’re going to be asking: who needs to be showing leadership? Which roles are the ones that shape the culture most decisively? And what sort of induction and training is most effective?</p>

<p>They are important questions, because whatever framework is put in place - robust codes, genuine independent oversight - can only be sustained and made effective if it is part of a culture where ethical issues are a normal part of thinking and decision-making at every level.</p>

<h3 id=""councillors"">Councillors</h3>

<p>There’s one group I haven’t talked about yet: councillors.</p>

<p>It’s ultimately the behaviour of councillors that we are interested in. Their conduct and probity in council business, their professional relations with officers and the public, and their decision-making when they have executive responsibilities or are serving on a committee.</p>

<p>Councillors play a hugely important role in local communities, one that can often be under-appreciated. They need guidance, training, and support to carry out that  role.</p>

<p>Lots of those we’ve spoken to have been clear that the vast majority of councillors stand for election because they want to serve their local communities, and they want to do so by observing the highest standards of conduct.</p>

<p>We want to celebrate the good work that goes on in councils up and down the country. Maintaining high standards are vital to ensuring that good work isn’t undermined or put at risk.</p>

<p>We want to hear directly from councillors themselves to get their view on the current system, and to get their perspective on what a standards regime needs to achieve. So we’ll be conducting site visits to a number of local authorities across England over the coming months.</p>

<h3 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h3>

<p>As I close, I want to offer some final reflections on the importance of ethical standards in local government.</p>

<p>Ethical standards are partly about protection. As Monitoring Officers, you are at the frontline protecting your local authorities - protecting their hard-won achievements from legal or governance risks, protecting their reputation, and, ultimately, playing a key part in protecting their future.</p>

<p>Getting standards right is vital to protecting an organisation and the individuals within it from conflicts of interest, reputational risks, or legal challenge.</p>

<p>Ethical standards are also about the ordinary, day-to-day interactions. Maintaining professional conduct and respect for others, and standing up against bullying and harassment, may seem so obvious that it does not need spelling out.</p>

<p>But an organisation that doesn’t have this embedded in its culture, at every level, can become toxic, and, in time, won’t retain good people and will struggle to carry out its core functions effectively.</p>

<p>And lastly, ethical standards are outward-looking. Having a culture of openness, scrutiny, and objective decision-making enables an organisation to take advantage of new opportunities, and to take effective decisions for the future that will have an impact on local communities.</p>

<p>So ethical standards are not just about avoiding scandal, or narrow compliance, but about having the public interest at the centre of everything that a local authority does and what it values. That’s what underpins the Nolan Principles. Out of that comes everything else - selflessness, integrity, honesty, openness, accountability, objectivity, leadership.</p>

<p>As a Committee, we hope that our review will play a part in helping local authorities to build that culture and maintain the highest standards of conduct.</p>

<p>We’ve been listening to Monitoring Officers throughout our review - at roundtables, through our public consultation - and we want to continue to listen to you as we draw our conclusions and form our recommendations to the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Because ultimately it’s not about us - the Committee on Standards in Public Life - but about you, and the work that councillors and officers do every day for the benefit of local communities.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

Speech
Dr Jane Martin CBE speech to Lawyers in Local Government Annual Monitoring Officers' Conference
Dr Jane Martin CBE addresses the Lawyers in Local Government Annual Monitoring Officers' conference, on the progress of the Committee's review into local government ethical standards.
Published 27 June 2018
From:
Committee on Standards in Public Life and Dr Jane  Martin  CBE
Delivered on: 
25 June 2018 (Speaker's notes, may differ from delivered version)
Thank you very much for inviting me to address your Annual Monitoring Officers’ Conference.
I’m here to speak mainly about the Committee’s current review of local government ethical standards, which I’m sure many of you will be aware of.
But I think it would be helpful to begin by introducing the Committee on Standards in Public Life and its work to help set the context in which we work.
The Committee was established in 1994 by the then Prime Minister, John Major, to address concerns about declining standards in public life. This was at the time of cash for questions, and worries about the politicisation of public appointments and relationships between politicians and businesses.
The first Committee, chaired by Lord Nolan, was asked to:
“Examine current concerns about standards of conduct of all holders of public office, including arrangements relating to financial and commercial activities, and make recommendations as to any changes in present arrangements which might be required to ensure the highest standards of propriety in public life.”
The Committee’s First Report set out Seven Principles, often now called the Nolan Principles: Selflessness, Integrity, Objectivity, Accountability, Openness, Honesty and Leadership.
These have been accepted by the public and those in public life as the baseline standard for conduct in public life, and remain the cornerstone of the UK’s ethical landscape.
The Committee is independent, non-partisan and non-statutory. The Committee looks across public life at emerging or potential standards issues, and reports directly to the Prime Minister.
We don’t have any formal powers or sanctions, and we don’t investigate individual cases. Our influence and credibility is founded on rigorous reports based on the best available evidence, that make clear, well-argued recommendations.
History of the Committee’s work
So, our work on local government. I’d like to spend a couple of minutes reviewing our past work and then consider some key themes that have emerged from our public consultation around the current system; the roles of Monitoring Officers and political parties; culture; and councillors’ behaviour in all this.
It’s fair to say that the Committee on Standards in Public Life has ‘form’ when it comes to local government standards.
The Committee’s Third Report, Standards of Conduct in Local Government in England, Scotland and Wales was published in 1997, and made a range of recommendations to improve ethical standards in local government.
These included introducing codes of conduct, public registers of interests, and rules on declaring interests. The Committee proposed that codes of conduct would be enforced by local standards committees with powers to suspend councillors, with national tribunals to hear appeals.
The government responded to the Committee’s report in 1998. Whilst the government agreed with a number of the Committee’s recommendations, they did not agree that local standards committees should have the primary responsibility for enforcing standards.
The government created the Standards Board for England, and the government issued a model code of conduct, which the Standards Board advised councils at the time not to supplement.
The Committee considered all these reforms in 2005. Its report criticised the centralised method for handling complaints and argued for substantial reform of the Standards Board. The government agreed, renaming the Standards Board, ‘Standards for England’ and changing its role and remit.
Our current inquiry is the first full review of local government that the Committee has undertaken since then.  The time feels right for us to look again and particularly in a environment where so much has changed.
A new context
Local government has always had responsibility for delivering significant public services, that citizens rely on day-in, day-out.
But it’s undeniable that councils are now involved in more outsourcing and commercial decision-making. They are also involved in more partnership working, for example, as part of Local Enterprise Partnerships.
This new environment creates new opportunities. But there are also potential risks: where lines of accountability are unclear, and where the best way of scrutinising complex arrangements hasn’t necessarily been established.
Those potential risks are heightened in an environment where there is diminished regulatory oversight of the sector, and where officers feel less able to challenge elected members. I’ll come back to that.
When it comes to the standards system, of course the Standards Board has been abolished, and responsibility for local standards has been given to local authorities.
I want to be clear that no-one during the course of our review has made a serious case for turning the clock back and returning to a centralised system.
Councils have told us that they value the flexibility of the current system, and the discretion to be able to resolve a issues informally.
What we are hearing from councils is that they want to be given the framework, tools and guidance to be able to maintain high standards in their own authority.
The standards framework
I want to spend some time now reflecting back some of the different views we’ve heard on the nuts and bolts of the current system.
Let me put some of you out of your misery and start with sanctions. We’ve heard loud and clear, in meetings, roundtables, and through our consultation: the current sanctions are not enough.
Monitoring Officers will know better than anyone else that without robust sanctions, councils can’t deal effectively with serious and persistent misconduct. This is the major gap in the current system.

First, dual- or triple-hatted councillors, who might have different requirements for registering or declaring interests, for example. And second, for principal authorities investigating breaches of parish codes.
Of course, some unitary authorities can have responsibility for 150 or 200 parishes, all of which - in principle - could have unique codes of conduct. But we’ve also seen that in some of these cases, town and parish councils have agreed a single, standard code.
Codes of conduct also vary in quality - with some codes relying on very broad provisions, which are difficult to adjudicate on and which can easily generate disputes over interpretation.
We’re going to be looking at best practice in this area and any guidance that could be given to councils when drawing up a code of conducts.
When it comes to declaring interests, we’ve heard that the current requirements don’t match the public’s expectations and don’t work for councillors either. Any system of declaring interests needs to have clarity for those who have to use it - so that you can know if you are keeping within the rules - and also needs to show that it’s protecting the public interest by preventing undue influence.
The Nolan Principle of integrity is clear, public office holders must avoid placing themselves under any obligation to people or organisations that might try inappropriately to influence them in their work, and need to declare and resolve any interests or relationships. The evidence we’ve received is that the current system could be tightened up and, at the same time, made clearer for councillors and officers.

We’ve heard some encouraging cases of good practice in how local authorities use their Independent Person and the insight they can bring, and we’ll be carefully considering the case for strengthening that role and putting it on a more formal footing.

<p>Scottish Secretary David Mundell has confirmed today [28 June 2018] that his department, as well as the Office of the Advocate General, will be joining the new and innovative <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/news/civil-service-hub-to-bring-growth-to-edinburgh"">UK Government Hub</a> in the New Waverley Development in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>The new Hub will bring together nearly 3,000 UK Government civil servants, from a range of departments, by 2020.  It will improve the work of the UK Government in Scotland, enabling closer collaboration between departments, helping them deliver better services for people in Scotland.  It is a key part of the UK Government’s commitment to building a strong Civil Service outside London.</p>

<p>Mr Mundell said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">The UK Government is delivering for Scotland. It is right that we have the right facilities to enable staff from across the whole of the UK Government to work together to deliver high quality services. The UK Government Hub demonstrates our commitment to supporting the Edinburgh economy – which we are also driving through the Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal.</p>

<p>Across the UK it is estimated that the UK Government Hubs programme will save more than £2 billion of public money over twenty years,  relocating civil servants from existing, often fragmented office locations, to modern, cross-departmental workplaces.</p>

Office of the Secretary of State for Scotland to join UK Government Edinburgh hub
The new hub at New Waverley, Edinburgh, which will deliver significant growth to the city by moving 2,900 civil servants into the city centre premises in 2020.
Published 28 June 2018
From:
Office of the Secretary of State for Scotland, Office of the Advocate General for Scotland, HM Revenue & Customs, Government Actuary's Department, Information Commissioner's Office, Government Property Agency, and The Rt Hon David Mundell MP
Scottish Secretary David Mundell has confirmed today [28 June 2018] that his department, as well as the Office of the Advocate General, will be joining the new and innovative UK Government Hub in the New Waverley Development in Edinburgh.
The new Hub will bring together nearly 3,000 UK Government civil servants, from a range of departments, by 2020.  It will improve the work of the UK Government in Scotland, enabling closer collaboration between departments, helping them deliver better services for people in Scotland.  It is a key part of the UK Government’s commitment to building a strong Civil Service outside London.
Mr Mundell said:
The UK Government is delivering for Scotland. It is right that we have the right facilities to enable staff from across the whole of the UK Government to work together to deliver high quality services. The UK Government Hub demonstrates our commitment to supporting the Edinburgh economy – which we are also driving through the Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal.
Across the UK it is estimated that the UK Government Hubs programme will save more than £2 billion of public money over twenty years,  relocating civil servants from existing, often fragmented office locations, to modern, cross-departmental workplaces.
The Office of the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Office of the Advocate General, will be joined by other UK Government departments and bodies including HMRC, the Office for Statistics Regulation, the Information Commissioner’s Office, the Government Actuary’s Department and HM Treasury.

<p>Parents who need help teaching their children reading, writing and language skills will get practical help such as home visits and online tools thanks to a £6.5 million scheme announced today (1 July).</p>

<p>Voluntary and community groups will get a share of the multi-million pound fund to run projects that help disadvantaged families and children with additional needs, building on the free childcare offer already available to the most deprived two-year-olds. These children are more likely to struggle with language and literacy skills when they arrive at primary school than their peers.</p>

<p>Studies have shown that helping parents and giving them the confidence to work with their children on speech and language is one of the most effective ways to ensure children arrive at school with the right foundations for a successful education.</p>

<p>Projects that can bid for the funding could include home visits from trained early years professionals, to help parents support their children in learning new words through simple steps like reading and singing nursery rhymes. Or they could involve easy-to-use online tools that help broaden the vocabulary parents use with their children in these early years.</p>

<p>Research shows that where there is a ‘word gap’ – the gap in communication skills between disadvantaged children and their peers - it can have a long term impact on a child’s education, so projects like these will help close it once and for all.</p>

<p>Education Secretary Damian Hinds said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Giving every child the best start in life means making sure the right early development opportunities are in place. That starts in the home, which means giving parents the confidence to help their children read, learn new words and social skills at an early age.</p>

  <p>Children from disadvantaged backgrounds or those with additional needs can face the greatest barriers in their early development, so it is important that where that help is needed it is in place as early as possible – such as through our free childcare for two-year-olds from lower income families which is used by more than 70% of those who are eligible.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">This funding boost will go to organisations with a proven track record of breaking down learning barriers for children with additional needs. This is an important part of this government’s work to improve education for every child, to make sure that this is a country that truly works for everyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>National voluntary and community groups will also be able to bid for funding to work with disadvantaged communities to encourage families to access the Government’s early education offers for children under five, as evidence shows high-quality early education can have a lasting impact on a child’s future.</p>

<p>Today’s announcement builds on the £13.5 million <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/news/multi-million-fund-to-boost-childrens-early-language-skills"">investment</a> announced in April to improve early language and literacy for disadvantaged children. This includes £5million for the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) to trial projects that support parents to help their children learn new words, and an £8.5 million programme for local authorities to make  improvements in early learning for local communities.</p>

<p>Previous successful bidders from the scheme include the National Literacy Trust, a charity that trains early years staff and volunteers to work with families, building parents’ confidence so that they can support their children’s communication, language and literacy skills at home. The Trust used the grant funding to set up Early Years Together at 2, a programme which invites parents and carers into the nursery to watch how children learn, and gives them practical ideas of how they can continue this learning at home.</p>

<p>Tara Parker, Senior Programme Manager for Early Years at the National Literacy Trust, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We were thrilled to be selected by the Department for Education to receive the Early Years VCS Grant last year. The grant enabled us to help 130 parents develop the skills and confidence they need to better support their child’s language and communication development at home.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">We have already started to see great results, with the two-year-olds involved in the programme becoming more interested in and engaged with books and songs. We were able to train early years practitioners across 20 settings. Having reported improved confidence in supporting parents, most settings will continue to deliver the programme to help even more families beyond the funding period.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Grants have also been issued to the charity Home-Start UK, which works closely with families facing personal difficulties, which can have a negative effect on children’s wellbeing and early development. The charity supports volunteers who work in communities, supporting families suffering from problems such as post-natal depression, physical health problems and bereavement. It received over £400,000 in grant funding to pilot a ‘word pedometer’ programme which provided disadvantaged families with coaching from trained home visiting volunteers, helping new parents increase the number and quality of words they use when interacting with their babies.</p>

<p>Rob Parkinson, chief executive, Home-Start UK:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">We know the number of words children hear in their very first days, months and years has a huge impact on their development. The grant from the Department of Education has been instrumental in establishing the pilot of this programme. Home-Start home visiting volunteers have been specially trained to work with the <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.home-start.org.uk/lena-home-language-development"">LENA Foundation’s</a> word pedometer and resulting graphs, sharing them with the family in a positive and accessible way each week. The grant been essential in being able to secure subsequent funding to help expand the project and giving us the opportunity to demonstrate its life-changing impact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Funding will be awarded to organisations that can demonstrate that projects will be self-sustaining, to ensure they will last to support future generations of children.</p>

<p>The Department for Education is working to target resources where they can have the greatest success in helping the early development of children with special educational needs and from disadvantaged backgrounds. The competition opens to bidders from today (1 July).</p>

<p>Winning projects will be announced later this year and go live in October, running until 2020.</p>

Studies have shown that helping parents and giving them the confidence to work with their children on speech and language is one of the most effective ways to ensure children arrive at school with the right foundations for a successful education.
Projects that can bid for the funding could include home visits from trained early years professionals, to help parents support their children in learning new words through simple steps like reading and singing nursery rhymes. Or they could involve easy-to-use online tools that help broaden the vocabulary parents use with their children in these early years.
Research shows that where there is a ‘word gap’ – the gap in communication skills between disadvantaged children and their peers - it can have a long term impact on a child’s education, so projects like these will help close it once and for all.
Education Secretary Damian Hinds said:
Giving every child the best start in life means making sure the right early development opportunities are in place. That starts in the home, which means giving parents the confidence to help their children read, learn new words and social skills at an early age.
Children from disadvantaged backgrounds or those with additional needs can face the greatest barriers in their early development, so it is important that where that help is needed it is in place as early as possible – such as through our free childcare for two-year-olds from lower income families which is used by more than 70% of those who are eligible.
This funding boost will go to organisations with a proven track record of breaking down learning barriers for children with additional needs. This is an important part of this government’s work to improve education for every child, to make sure that this is a country that truly works for everyone.
National voluntary and community groups will also be able to bid for funding to work with disadvantaged communities to encourage families to access the Government’s early education offers for children under five, as evidence shows high-quality early education can have a lasting impact on a child’s future.
Today’s announcement builds on the £13.5 million investment announced in April to improve early language and literacy for disadvantaged children. This includes £5million for the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) to trial projects that support parents to help their children learn new words, and an £8.5 million programme for local authorities to make  improvements in early learning for local communities.
Previous successful bidders from the scheme include the National Literacy Trust, a charity that trains early years staff and volunteers to work with families, building parents’ confidence so that they can support their children’s communication, language and literacy skills at home. The Trust used the grant funding to set up Early Years Together at 2, a programme which invites parents and carers into the nursery to watch how children learn, and gives them practical ideas of how they can continue this learning at home.
Tara Parker, Senior Programme Manager for Early Years at the National Literacy Trust, said:
We were thrilled to be selected by the Department for Education to receive the Early Years VCS Grant last year. The grant enabled us to help 130 parents develop the skills and confidence they need to better support their child’s language and communication development at home.
We have already started to see great results, with the two-year-olds involved in the programme becoming more interested in and engaged with books and songs. We were able to train early years practitioners across 20 settings. Having reported improved confidence in supporting parents, most settings will continue to deliver the programme to help even more families beyond the funding period.
Grants have also been issued to the charity Home-Start UK, which works closely with families facing personal difficulties, which can have a negative effect on children’s wellbeing and early development. The charity supports volunteers who work in communities, supporting families suffering from problems such as post-natal depression, physical health problems and bereavement. It received over £400,000 in grant funding to pilot a ‘word pedometer’ programme which provided disadvantaged families with coaching from trained home visiting volunteers, helping new parents increase the number and quality of words they use when interacting with their babies.
Rob Parkinson, chief executive, Home-Start UK:
We know the number of words children hear in their very first days, months and years has a huge impact on their development. The grant from the Department of Education has been instrumental in establishing the pilot of this programme. Home-Start home visiting volunteers have been specially trained to work with the LENA Foundation’s word pedometer and resulting graphs, sharing them with the family in a positive and accessible way each week. The grant been essential in being able to secure subsequent funding to help expand the project and giving us the opportunity to demonstrate its life-changing impact.
Funding will be awarded to organisations that can demonstrate that projects will be self-sustaining, to ensure they will last to support future generations of children.
The Department for Education is working to target resources where they can have the greatest success in helping the early development of children with special educational needs and from disadvantaged backgrounds. The competition opens to bidders from today (1 July).
Winning projects will be announced later this year and go live in October, running until 2020.

      <div class=""govspeak"">
<p>Safeguarding children requires a multi-agency response. It cannot be done by local authorities alone. This is true across all aspects of safeguarding arrangements: from the frontline practitioner identifying a child at risk and making a referral to the local authority, through to leaders determining local strategic and operational responses to child protection issues. We must get this right for all children who experience abuse or neglect.</p>

<p>With the publication of the new <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-together-to-safeguard-children--2"">‘Working together to safeguard children’</a> and local areas moving to new multi-agency safeguarding arrangements for children, this seems an opportune moment to talk about the important factors that we see enabling effective local multi-agency arrangements for safeguarding. What happens at a strategic level matters. It can lead to improvements in the support, protection and care that vulnerable children receive. It can also lead to the opposite if arrangements are not working.</p>

<p>I want to talk about our findings in our Local Safeguarding Children Board (<abbr title=""Local Safeguarding Children Board"">LSCB</abbr>) reviews and our joint targeted area inspections (<abbr title=""joint targeted area inspections"">JTAIs</abbr>).</p>

<p>When talking about multi-agency safeguarding, we always need to ask the question, ‘What does this mean for children?’</p>

<p>We do not think it is appropriate to prescribe any 1 model of working. What we would like to see is that as agencies set up their new arrangements, they remember the ingredients that worked in their previous ones while challenging themselves to innovate and learn from the experience of others.</p>

<h2 id=""what-we-have-found-and-what-we-would-like-to-see"">What we have found and what we would like to see</h2>

<p>The best local safeguarding arrangements are developed from a shared vision and shared values. It is about all agencies involved being ambitious to secure the very best responses to children at risk of harm in their community. Local safeguarding arrangements work well when there is a clear line of sight on both the operational and the strategic response locally. Agencies need to know the quality of their frontline practice. They must understand the direct experiences of children and their families in their local area.</p>

<p>Without good leadership, safeguarding arrangements will fail. This means that each of the 3 lead safeguarding partners must step up to the task in hand: the police, health and the local authority. It means working together to ensure a joined-up local response to reduce the risk of harm to children. This is about leaders who understand their local context. Children and their families do not live in silos, so it is critical that leaders create an environment in which multi-agency working can flourish.</p>

<h2 id=""components-of-successful-partnerships"">Components of successful partnerships</h2>

<p>The <abbr title=""joint targeted area inspections"">JTAIs</abbr> have helped identify what the components are for good multi-agency working. I will go into each of these in more detail throughout this commentary.</p>

<figure class=""image embedded""><div class=""img""><img src=""https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/76755/Image_for_multi-agency_safeguarding.jpg"" alt=""Diagram showing different elements for an environment in which effective multi-agency practice can flourish.""></div></figure><h3 id=""effective-ambitious-child-focused-leadership-within-and-across-partners"">Effective, ambitious child-focused leadership within and across partners</h3>

<p>It is important that the lead safeguarding partners articulate and communicate a clear vision across the local partnership. This should include the message that child protection is everybody’s responsibility. They need everyone involved to commit to a joined-up approach to improving the response to vulnerable children. All partners need to have a clear vision for multi-agency practice, which is shared with all staff.</p>

<h3 id=""understanding-local-need-and-using-information-to-protect-children"">Understanding local need and using information to protect children</h3>

<p>We have found that the <abbr title=""Local Safeguarding Children Boards"">LSCBs</abbr> that influenced practice most effectively receive the right information from across different agencies, including from multi-agency audits. They then analysed this information to:</p>

<ul>
<li>understand local need</li>
  <li>get an understanding of frontline practice</li>
  <li>develop well-informed priorities</li>
  <li>decide what action to take to improve frontline services</li>
</ul>
<p>Some areas have used performance data, qualitative information and their local strategic needs analysis exceptionally well to identify their priorities and take action to protect children. It is important that lead safeguarding partners ensure that they have access to the right information to enable them to take effective action.</p>

<p>For example, in Camden the board noticed a clear correlation between children who self-harm and parents who have mental health problems. This led to a multi-agency audit on parental mental illness. As a result, it became a priority work area for the board.</p>

<p>It is not just about knowing what is happening on the frontline but responding to it effectively. There are 2 other good examples from Camden to illustrate this:</p>

<ol>
<li>When there was a high incidence of hate crime near a particular school, information was quickly shared with the <abbr title=""Local Safeguarding Children Board"">LSCB</abbr>. It was seen as a multi-agency responsibility. This good network and strong communication enabled swift and clear messages to be given to parents, along with advice on how to access support.</li>
  <li>When it became evident from a high number of referrals from a specific school that child sexual exploitation was a particularly prominent issue, Camden promptly used its resources to organise additional training and support for school staff.</li>
</ol>
<p>We also found some excellent examples from other areas.</p>

<p>In Cheshire West and Chester, the <abbr title=""Local Safeguarding Children Board"">LSCB</abbr> and the local authority have worked collaboratively to develop a set of ‘neglect indicators’. This has enabled them to map early help and children’s social care activity about neglect and to assess demand and need across the area.</p>

<p>In Lincolnshire, strategic arrangements for managing and overseeing work to combat domestic abuse are well developed. They are based on a strong understanding of the extent and nature of domestic abuse and are having a good impact across services. Our report said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is good awareness and ownership of the domestic abuse joint protocol by frontline staff across agencies. There has also been a strong focus on equipping frontline staff.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">Strategic action plans are well considered and comprehensive, and are underpinned by a strong shared vision and ambition to reduce incidents of domestic abuse and prevent their re-occurrence. Senior leaders across the range of Adult and Children’s Safeguarding Boards, the Public Protection Board and the Community Safety Partnership have a detailed understanding of the prevalence of domestic abuse and the impact on children in their area.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The partnership in Lincolnshire has an effective domestic abuse strategy and a comprehensive joint protocol to guide all professionals working with those affected by domestic abuse. The Adults’ and Children’s Safeguarding Boards and the Domestic Abuse Strategic Management Board developed this protocol. Hundreds of frontline professionals attended its launch at a learning event. This, together with a wide range of training, means that many staff across agencies now have the knowledge and assessment tools required to better understand and manage risks related to domestic abuse. We found that practitioners across the partnership were aware of the protocol and that many were using the resources to good effect. For example, routine enquiries about ‘domestic abuse, stalking and honour-based violence assessments’ are now well embedded in frontline staff’s practice across all three NHS trusts. Multi-agency risk assessment conferences help to maintain a vigilant approach to managing high risks.</p>

<h3 id=""wide-and-active-engagement-in-multi-agency-safeguarding-arrangements"">Wide and active engagement in multi-agency safeguarding arrangements</h3>

<p>It is essential that the lead agencies ensure that there is wide and active engagement in multi-agency safeguarding arrangements by other partner agencies, including in the voluntary sector, education and adult services. Otherwise, partners across other agencies do not own, understand or implement multi-agency strategies and the strategies will not have the required impact for children.</p>

<p>For example, at a strategic level there may be lots of work to develop neglect strategies and tools. But if frontline staff across all agencies, including adult services, do not understand or use the tools the strategy will be ineffective. In Cheshire West and Chester, we saw a wide range of agencies including youth offending services involved in developing a neglect strategy and in providing the training. The impact was that their staff owned and used the tools to good effect, increasing recognition of children living with neglect.</p>

<h3 id=""getting-the-priorities-right"">Getting the priorities right.</h3>

<p>Challenges will be different in each local area.</p>

<p>The best <abbr title=""Local Safeguarding Children Boards"">LSCBs</abbr> have not been over-reliant on the local authority’s information, but use information from across the partnership. The information enables them to:</p>

<ul>
<li>ask the right questions</li>
  <li>identify the right priorities</li>
  <li>take the right actions</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, in Camden the board’s priorities are clear. They are based on a thorough analysis of local needs and reflect learning from serious case reviews, both locally and nationally. All board partners are able to explain the board’s priorities and give examples of how they work collaboratively to deliver them.</p>

<p>Not being clear about the priorities can lead to poor practice. When <abbr title=""Local Safeguarding Children Boards"">LSCBs</abbr> are judged to be inadequate, they have often not prioritised child protection sufficiently or do not understand important aspects of it well enough. It is important that the partners maintain a very clear focus on the protection of children, including early help and protecting those who are looked after or care leavers.</p>

<h3 id=""ensuring-a-joined-up-approach"">Ensuring a joined-up approach</h3>

<p>Local safeguarding arrangements need to be closely aligned with the priorities of other strategic bodies, such as the adult safeguarding board (<abbr title=""adult safeguarding board"">ASB</abbr>), health and well-being board and the community safety partnership. ‘Working together’ makes it clear that in the new arrangements the leaders must make and maintain these links.</p>

<p>Good strategic links between partners’ objectives and priorities and those of other decision-making bodies are essential. You need the right connections to deliver effective multi-agency working.</p>

<p>In our <abbr title=""joint targeted area inspection"">JTAI</abbr> about children living with domestic abuse, this was very apparent. We found that it was vital to have clarity of roles and to share information between the community safety partnership, <abbr title=""Local Safeguarding Children Board"">LSCB</abbr>, <abbr title=""adult safeguarding board"">ASB</abbr>, and health and well-being board. This should lead to shared priorities, a shared ownership of work and a joined-up approach to commissioning services.</p>

<p>We saw this working well in Islington, where the <abbr title=""Local Safeguarding Children Board"">LSCB</abbr> has worked with the Youth Justice Management Board to revolutionise the local response to gangs and youth violence.</p>

<h3 id=""agencies-understanding-their-respective-roles-and-thresholds"">Agencies understanding their respective roles and thresholds</h3>

<h4 id=""involving-all-partner-agencies"">Involving all partner agencies</h4>

<p>While the new safeguarding arrangements focus on the local authority, the police and health, it is essential that other safeguarding partners such as the voluntary sector, education and adult services are involved and have ownership of multi-agency working to protect children.</p>

<p>For example, the importance of schools and early years settings is explicitly referenced in ‘Working together’.</p>

<p>Their role in identifying and supporting vulnerable older children is significant. We found some very positive examples of schools supporting children experiencing multiple forms of abuse in the <abbr title=""joint targeted area inspection"">JTAI</abbr> about children living with neglect.</p>

<p>In Bristol, we found that the partnership prioritises and supports schools’ role in safeguarding children. There is very good engagement with and support for schools through the safeguarding in schools team. Early help managers have helped schools to identify and respond to neglect effectively.</p>

<p>Bristol’s strong work in schools to support children who are identified as suffering from neglect means that concerns about individual children and families are identified at an early stage. The report noted:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">… work of the learning mentors, family support workers or home-school workers is, in many cases, highly effective in identifying and monitoring older children who suffer from neglect. School budgets also fund therapies such as art and play, which can help to meet the needs of children and so prevent the need for a referral to children’s social care. The good relationships between school staff and children’s social care staff mean that support and guidance is available to support the referral process. School staff’s knowledge of children and their families in their community is a great strength in enabling support for older children experiencing neglect.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id=""understanding-professional-practice-and-valuing-professional-disciplines-and-expertise"">Understanding professional practice and valuing professional disciplines and expertise</h3>

<p>In partnerships that have a strong grounding in professional practice and a shared commitment to protecting children, it is likely to be more straightforward to agree priorities and work together.</p>

<p>In my view, there needs to be a good understanding of professional practice to enable good quality decision-making at a strategic level. The challenge is how this is achieved while making sure that the arrangements allow timely decision-making. We have seen a number of ways that <abbr title=""Local Safeguarding Children Boards"">LSCBs</abbr> have achieved this. But the important message is that the best multi-agency strategic arrangements are based on a very good knowledge of professional practice.</p>

<p>An example of this issue is in the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/social-care-monthly-commentary-march-2017"">multi-agency front door</a> (the initial point of contact when someone has concerns about a child). Here, multi-agency decision-making can happen virtually or through co-location. Different agencies and professionals always have a variety of expertise. Valuing that range of expertise and difference in perspective and focus is critical. Bringing it all together leads to better decision-making.</p>

<p>However, simply sitting in the same room as one another is not enough. Inspectors have found instances of agencies located together but still missing opportunities to share information and make joint decisions. All agencies must understand their own and each other’s roles, no matter where they are located.</p>

<p>Understanding of thresholds and different roles and responsibilities across agencies remains a significant challenge across all aspects of children in need and child protection. For example, in the recent neglect <abbr title=""joint targeted area inspection"">JTAI</abbr> some professionals were not aware of the role of community rehabilitation companies (<abbr title=""community rehabilitation companies"">CRC</abbr>) and the national probation services (<abbr title=""national probation services"">NPS</abbr>). Therefore, they did not always share appropriate information or seek information about children linked to adults involved with these services. We are finding this lack of understanding of thresholds in emerging areas of concern such as ‘county lines’ and criminal exploitation.</p>

<h3 id=""good-systems-for-information-sharing-which-professionals-are-confident-and-knowledgeable-about"">Good systems for information sharing which professionals are confident and knowledgeable about</h3>

<p>We are still finding examples of confusion and poor practice when it comes to information sharing. This is directly impacting on children.</p>

<p>Examples include:</p>

<ul>
<li>a school that reported to an inspector that they could not share information about domestic abuse unless they had the parents’ permission</li>
  <li>different health professionals working with older neglected children not sharing information about the same child so that each one does not have the most up-to-date information about all aspects of a child’s well-being, health and sexual health</li>
  <li>nurses not always sharing relevant information when there are indicators of child sexual abuse</li>
  <li>information not always being shared with <abbr title=""community rehabilitation companies"">CRC</abbr> and <abbr title=""national probation services"">NPS</abbr>, and information about children linked to adults involved with these services not being requested</li>
</ul>
<p>Better examples of information are also evident. In Hampshire, ‘IT systems ensure that agencies can access and share information. For example, multi-agency safeguarding hub (<abbr title=""multi-agency safeguarding hub"">MASH</abbr>) health practitioners have access to the children’s social care records. The recent facility for health services to have access to a number of GP summary care records for adults and children has been helpful, both in enhancing initial information gathering and the quality of risk assessment within the <abbr title=""multi-agency safeguarding hub"">MASH</abbr>.’</p>

<p>In Wiltshire, <abbr title=""multi-agency safeguarding hub"">MASH</abbr> practitioners hold a daily domestic abuse conference call to discuss domestic abuse cases and share information in a timely manner across multiple agencies.</p>

<h3 id=""strong-support-and-challenge-within-the-multi-agency-system"">Strong support and challenge within the multi-agency system</h3>

<p>We know that high support and high challenge can create an environment in which practice can flourish. This includes good quality training and supervision and needs to be in place for the whole multi-agency partnership.</p>

<p>Building trust and confidence between partners is complex. But we have seen agencies that are able to challenge each other and professionals who understand the processes for escalating concerns about children or for challenging decisions about children. In many of these cases, we have seen better outcomes for children. This is often an indicator of a healthy partnership. In a recent <abbr title=""joint targeted area inspection"">JTAI</abbr>, some schools told us that because they knew they understood the escalation process and knew they would be taken seriously they felt confident in challenging decisions. We saw that this made a difference for children. The three lead partners will need to think carefully about how they build that culture of healthy challenge.</p>

<p>The importance of independent scrutiny is summed up well in the Stockton-On-Tees <abbr title=""joint targeted area inspection"">JTAI</abbr> report:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">The <abbr title=""Local Safeguarding Children Board"">LSCB</abbr> has a strong and independent identity. This means that challenges to agencies that arise from the board’s monitoring and scrutiny role carry a sufficient degree of authority to ensure that the agencies respond positively and work to address areas of weaker practice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Section 11 audits have really made a difference in terms of scrutiny and challenge when they are carried out well. They can provide good evidence about work at both strategic and practice levels and can enable agencies to be held to account. Inspectors have seen that ‘challenge days’ can make a positive difference. This is when agencies come together to discuss the findings from Section 11 audits and to be held account for taking timely and appropriate action to address any gaps in their safeguarding response.</p>

<h3 id=""an-environment-in-which-multi-agency-practice-can-flourish"">An environment in which multi-agency practice can flourish</h3>

<p>All the components described in this commentary lead to an environment where multi-agency practice can flourish. Building this sort of environment should be at the heart of any new arrangements.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned the importance of a common purpose and understanding across partner agencies. Other important ingredients for this environment are:</p>

<ul>
<li>training and learning being multi-agency, where appropriate</li>
  <li>multi-agency auditing and subsequent ownership and action planning</li>
  <li>developing multi-agency tools to enable a common approach to and understanding of child protection</li>
</ul>
<p>Cheshire West and Chester is a good example of having the right environment for multi-agency work to thrive. Its inspection report stated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Cheshire West Local Safeguarding Children Board (<abbr title=""Local Safeguarding Children Board"">LSCB</abbr>) has taken the lead in developing and promoting the use of evidence-based tools to support practice, and there is a cycle of continual review and sharpening of responses to tackle neglect. For example, learning from audit is leading to a further refinement of these tools, including the development of an assessment tool for older children. A wide range of agencies are involved in <abbr title=""Local Safeguarding Children Board"">LSCB</abbr> audits and the findings are widely disseminated across partner agencies, leading to improvements in practice.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">Practitioners across all health services use a range of risk assessment tools provided by the <abbr title=""Local Safeguarding Children Board"">LSCB</abbr>, alongside specific health assessment tools, to support them in assessing the risk of neglect and to inform decisions to refer on. This was seen, in cases, to help practitioners understand the specific needs of children and the impact of neglect on children across age ranges.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id=""having-a-line-of-sight-to-practice"">Having a line of sight to practice</h3>

<p>Multi-agency partnerships need an effective system to monitor and evaluate the impact of their work on the progress and experiences of children in their local area. They also need to act on any areas of practice that need improvement and monitor what happens next.</p>

<p>There needs to be a clear understanding of what is happening in frontline practice. Only then can you improve the quality of services and appropriately influence the planning and commissioning of services to help and protect children. Having a culture of scrutiny and challenge that leads to improvements in safeguarding will maintain a focus on the right issues. In our view, multi-agency audits can be a real driver of getting it right.</p>

<p>We know that there are points in the system where to take your eye off the ball is more risky. For example, leaders should never lose sight of the quality of <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/social-care-monthly-commentary-march-2017"">referrals and decision-making at the front door</a>. Keeping a grip on the quality of practice here is key to getting it right for children. Robust auditing activity gives senior leaders the insight that they need.</p>

<h3 id=""the-importance-of-multi-agency-auditing"">The importance of multi-agency auditing</h3>

<p>While most areas have multi-agency audits in place, the quality is highly variable and evidence of impact as a result if not always clear. Not all partnerships are involving service user feedback in audits and not all feed back directly to staff. Therefore, learning is limited.</p>

<p>When multi-agency audits are done well, they enable significant insight into both individual agency practice, multi-agency practice and the impact on the lives of children and families. They act as a driver for improvement. During the <abbr title=""joint targeted area inspections"">JTAIs</abbr>, we have found that agencies can learn as much from good practice examples as they can from identifying lessons learned from deficits in practice. Engaging staff in audits is more effective in improving practice, as is ensuring wide dissemination of the learning.</p>

<p>Derby uses auditing effectively to make a difference to the lives of children. When it carries out an audit and completes a review of progress, staff plan a further audit to make sure that the desired improvements happen. Derby has used this approach well when tackling the issue of neglect. When the board members recognised that improvement was happening too slowly, they acted swiftly. They more than doubled the number of training courses on neglect available and introduced a specific neglect element in mandatory multi-agency safeguarding courses. Derby then planned a further audit to assess the impact of this additional training on improving practice.</p>

<h3 id=""creating-a-culture-of-continuous-improvement-and-learning"">Creating a culture of continuous improvement and learning</h3>

<p>Part of creating the right environment for multi-agency working to flourish is to create a learning culture.</p>

<p>A good example of this is one I am very familiar with, in Merton:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">The board promotes a culture of continuous development. Learning from SCRs and learning improvement reviews is used to improve safeguarding practice and in the development of multi-agency policies. The routine and innovative use of single- and multi-agency case file audit means that the board can assure itself of the quality and impact of frontline social work practice and take decisive action to drive improvement. The collaboration of partners at both strategic and operational level allows for alerts and trends to be identified and acted on swiftly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id=""multi-agency-training-that-makes-a-positive-difference-to-practice"">Multi-agency training that makes a positive difference to practice</h3>

<p>Training helps. We think multi-agency training is even more important. Helping practitioners to have a shared understanding and be better sighted in each other’s roles can make a positive difference to frontline practice.</p>

<p>For example, in Wokingham we saw direct examples of multi-agency training on neglect leading to improving practice in casework with children living with neglect.</p>

<p>South Tyneside also has a comprehensive training offer, which the board develops through consultation and analysis. Training is evaluated to ensure that it is raising awareness and improving practice. Our report said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">The training offer is well aligned to the strategic priorities of partnerships to improve working practice in safeguarding children and improving outcomes. A strength of the workforce development group has been its merger with the training group from the Safeguarding Adults Board. This supports coordinated working on the ‘think family’ approach, especially in response to children in families in which alcohol, substance misuse, domestic abuse and mental ill health are prevalent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Stockton-On-Tees, we found more good learning opportunities:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[With] the <abbr title=""Local Safeguarding Children Board"">LSCB</abbr> conference, statement of intent, neglect training and roll-out of the evidence-based tool for identifying neglect, individual agencies are focused on enhancing the knowledge and skills of frontline staff to tackle neglect.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">Recent initiatives include the local authority’s ‘topic of the month’ focus on adolescent neglect in August and September, neglect training delivered in termly forum meetings with school-designated safeguarding leads and quick awareness-raising measures, such as Cleveland police’s child neglect screensaver. Alongside the roll-out of the neglect assessment tool, the ongoing adoption of the family work model across agencies is beginning to support a sharper focus on both neglect and the lived experiences of children.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id=""engaging-children-in-strategic-developments"">Engaging children in strategic developments.</h3>

<p>The views and engagement of children should play a pivotal role in the work of the partnership. They should influence service developments. I would ask that as you think through how you are going to work together, you think about how the views of stakeholders can influence what you do and how you do it.</p>

<p>In Derby, staff have engaged children well in the process of creating and disseminating learning materials that have directly led to greater awareness and the prevention of harm, such as the short film ‘Alright Charlie’. A group of Year 6 girls used their learning from watching this film to protect themselves from harm and to provide evidence to the police that supported the successful prosecution of a perpetrator.</p>

<p>North Lincolnshire involves children in all areas of the board’s work, such as learning from serious case reviews. A group of children, dedicated to promoting positive emotional well-being and mental health, produced a ‘positive steps’ leaflet. They organised a conference to raise awareness of children and professionals. Children have also been at the forefront of developing the North Lincolnshire Children and Young People’s Emotional Health and Well-being Transformation Plan.</p>

<h2 id=""summary"">Summary</h2>

<p>I want us to continue to debate how strategic arrangements for safeguarding children can improve multi-agency working so that children in need and their families get a joined-up, effective and proportionate response at the frontline.</p>

<p>As I have said before, no one agency can create an effective child protection system by itself. Only a joined-up approach at a strategic level will mean that vulnerable children receive a better response.</p>

<p>To test the effectiveness of strategic arrangements, we must always ask: ‘How is joint working making a positive difference to the lives and experiences of individual children and their families?’ At their very best, local arrangements show that ambitious, joined-up strategic partnership while also having a clear line of sight on practice, on the experiences of children and on the impact of that direct work.</p>

<p>My experience has highlighted the importance of scrutiny and challenge in partnership arrangements, for which there needs to be an independent element. I want to continue to ask the question about how independent scrutiny works best in improving multi-agency working combined with local mutual scrutiny and challenge.</p>

<p>We all have a responsibility to maintain a relentless focus on improving the multi-agency response to children in need of help and protection and their families. We will continue to share examples of where this has been done well, and collaborate closely with our colleagues in <abbr title=""Her Majesty's"">HM</abbr> Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services, the Care Quality Commission and <abbr title=""Her Majesty's Inspector"">HMI</abbr> Probation to monitor and raise any areas of concern.

Social care commentary: multi-agency safeguarding arrangements
Ofsted's National Director of Social Care,Yvette Stanley, discusses the important ingredients for multi-agency safeguarding arrangements to improve the response to children in need of help and protection.
Published 10 July 2018
From:
Ofsted and Yvette Stanley
Written on: 
10 July 2018
Safeguarding children requires a multi-agency response. It cannot be done by local authorities alone. This is true across all aspects of safeguarding arrangements: from the frontline practitioner identifying a child at risk and making a referral to the local authority, through to leaders determining local strategic and operational responses to child protection issues. We must get this right for all children who experience abuse or neglect.
With the publication of the new ‘Working together to safeguard children’ and local areas moving to new multi-agency safeguarding arrangements for children, this seems an opportune moment to talk about the important factors that we see enabling effective local multi-agency arrangements for safeguarding. What happens at a strategic level matters. It can lead to improvements in the support, protection and care that vulnerable children receive. It can also lead to the opposite if arrangements are not working.
I want to talk about our findings in our Local Safeguarding Children Board (LSCB) reviews and our joint targeted area inspections (JTAIs).
When talking about multi-agency safeguarding, we always need to ask the question, ‘What does this mean for children?’
We do not think it is appropriate to prescribe any 1 model of working. What we would like to see is that as agencies set up their new arrangements, they remember the ingredients that worked in their previous ones while challenging themselves to innovate and learn from the experience of others.
What we have found and what we would like to see
The best local safeguarding arrangements are developed from a shared vision and shared values. It is about all agencies involved being ambitious to secure the very best responses to children at risk of harm in their community. Local safeguarding arrangements work well when there is a clear line of sight on both the operational and the strategic response locally. Agencies need to know the quality of their frontline practice. They must understand the direct experiences of children and their families in their local area.
Without good leadership, safeguarding arrangements will fail. This means that each of the 3 lead safeguarding partners must step up to the task in hand: the police, health and the local authority. It means working together to ensure a joined-up local response to reduce the risk of harm to children. This is about leaders who understand their local context. Children and their families do not live in silos, so it is critical that leaders create an environment in which multi-agency working can flourish.
Components of successful partnerships
The JTAIs have helped identify what the components are for good multi-agency working. I will go into each of these in more detail throughout this commentary.
Effective, ambitious child-focused leadership within and across partners
It is important that the lead safeguarding partners articulate and communicate a clear vision across the local partnership. This should include the message that child protection is everybody’s responsibility. They need everyone involved to commit to a joined-up approach to improving the response to vulnerable children. All partners need to have a clear vision for multi-agency practice, which is shared with all staff.
Understanding local need and using information to protect children
We have found that the LSCBs that influenced practice most effectively receive the right information from across different agencies, including from multi-agency audits. They then analysed this information to:
understand local need
get an understanding of frontline practice
develop well-informed priorities
decide what action to take to improve frontline services
Some areas have used performance data, qualitative information and their local strategic needs analysis exceptionally well to identify their priorities and take action to protect children. It is important that lead safeguarding partners ensure that they have access to the right information to enable them to take effective action.
For example, in Camden the board noticed a clear correlation between children who self-harm and parents who have mental health problems. This led to a multi-agency audit on parental mental illness. As a result, it became a priority work area for the board.
It is not just about knowing what is happening on the frontline but responding to it effectively. There are 2 other good examples from Camden to illustrate this:
When there was a high incidence of hate crime near a particular school, information was quickly shared with the LSCB. It was seen as a multi-agency responsibility. This good network and strong communication enabled swift and clear messages to be given to parents, along with advice on how to access support.
When it became evident from a high number of referrals from a specific school that child sexual exploitation was a particularly prominent issue, Camden promptly used its resources to organise additional training and support for school staff.
We also found some excellent examples from other areas.
In Cheshire West and Chester, the LSCB and the local authority have worked collaboratively to develop a set of ‘neglect indicators’. This has enabled them to map early help and children’s social care activity about neglect and to assess demand and need across the area.
In Lincolnshire, strategic arrangements for managing and overseeing work to combat domestic abuse are well developed. They are based on a strong understanding of the extent and nature of domestic abuse and are having a good impact across services. Our report said:
There is good awareness and ownership of the domestic abuse joint protocol by frontline staff across agencies. There has also been a strong focus on equipping frontline staff.
Strategic action plans are well considered and comprehensive, and are underpinned by a strong shared vision and ambition to reduce incidents of domestic abuse and prevent their re-occurrence. Senior leaders across the range of Adult and Children’s Safeguarding Boards, the Public Protection Board and the Community Safety Partnership have a detailed understanding of the prevalence of domestic abuse and the impact on children in their area.
The partnership in Lincolnshire has an effective domestic abuse strategy and a comprehensive joint protocol to guide all professionals working with those affected by domestic abuse. The Adults’ and Children’s Safeguarding Boards and the Domestic Abuse Strategic Management Board developed this protocol. Hundreds of frontline professionals attended its launch at a learning event. This, together with a wide range of training, means that many staff across agencies now have the knowledge and assessment tools required to better understand and manage risks related to domestic abuse. We found that practitioners across the partnership were aware of the protocol and that many were using the resources to good effect. For example, routine enquiries about ‘domestic abuse, stalking and honour-based violence assessments’ are now well embedded in frontline staff’s practice across all three NHS trusts. Multi-agency risk assessment conferences help to maintain a vigilant approach to managing high risks.
Wide and active engagement in multi-agency safeguarding arrangements
It is essential that the lead agencies ensure that there is wide and active engagement in multi-agency safeguarding arrangements by other partner agencies, including in the voluntary sector, education and adult services. Otherwise, partners across other agencies do not own, understand or implement multi-agency strategies and the strategies will not have the required impact for children.
For example, at a strategic level there may be lots of work to develop neglect strategies and tools. But if frontline staff across all agencies, including adult services, do not understand or use the tools the strategy will be ineffective. In Cheshire West and Chester, we saw a wide range of agencies including youth offending services involved in developing a neglect strategy and in providing the training. The impact was that their staff owned and used the tools to good effect, increasing recognition of children living with neglect.
Getting the priorities right.
Challenges will be different in each local area.
The best LSCBs have not been over-reliant on the local authority’s information, but use information from across the partnership. The information enables them to:
ask the right questions
identify the right priorities
take the right actions
For example, in Camden the board’s priorities are clear. They are based on a thorough analysis of local needs and reflect learning from serious case reviews, both locally and nationally. All board partners are able to explain the board’s priorities and give examples of how they work collaboratively to deliver them.
Not being clear about the priorities can lead to poor practice. When LSCBs are judged to be inadequate, they have often not prioritised child protection sufficiently or do not understand important aspects of it well enough. It is important that the partners maintain a very clear focus on the protection of children, including early help and protecting those who are looked after or care leavers.
Ensuring a joined-up approach
Local safeguarding arrangements need to be closely aligned with the priorities of other strategic bodies, such as the adult safeguarding board (ASB), health and well-being board and the community safety partnership. ‘Working together’ makes it clear that in the new arrangements the leaders must make and maintain these links.
Good strategic links between partners’ objectives and priorities and those of other decision-making bodies are essential. You need the right connections to deliver effective multi-agency working.
In our JTAI about children living with domestic abuse, this was very apparent. We found that it was vital to have clarity of roles and to share information between the community safety partnership, LSCB, ASB, and health and well-being board. This should lead to shared priorities, a shared ownership of work and a joined-up approach to commissioning services.
We saw this working well in Islington, where the LSCB has worked with the Youth Justice Management Board to revolutionise the local response to gangs and youth violence.
Agencies understanding their respective roles and thresholds
Involving all partner agencies
While the new safeguarding arrangements focus on the local authority, the police and health, it is essential that other safeguarding partners such as the voluntary sector, education and adult services are involved and have ownership of multi-agency working to protect children.
For example, the importance of schools and early years settings is explicitly referenced in ‘Working together’.
Their role in identifying and supporting vulnerable older children is significant. We found some very positive examples of schools supporting children experiencing multiple forms of abuse in the JTAI about children living with neglect.
In Bristol, we found that the partnership prioritises and supports schools’ role in safeguarding children. There is very good engagement with and support for schools through the safeguarding in schools team. Early help managers have helped schools to identify and respond to neglect effectively.
Bristol’s strong work in schools to support children who are identified as suffering from neglect means that concerns about individual children and families are identified at an early stage. The report noted:
… work of the learning mentors, family support workers or home-school workers is, in many cases, highly effective in identifying and monitoring older children who suffer from neglect. School budgets also fund therapies such as art and play, which can help to meet the needs of children and so prevent the need for a referral to children’s social care. The good relationships between school staff and children’s social care staff mean that support and guidance is available to support the referral process. School staff’s knowledge of children and their families in their community is a great strength in enabling support for older children experiencing neglect.
Understanding professional practice and valuing professional disciplines and expertise
In partnerships that have a strong grounding in professional practice and a shared commitment to protecting children, it is likely to be more straightforward to agree priorities and work together.
In my view, there needs to be a good understanding of professional practice to enable good quality decision-making at a strategic level. The challenge is how this is achieved while making sure that the arrangements allow timely decision-making. We have seen a number of ways that LSCBs have achieved this. But the important message is that the best multi-agency strategic arrangements are based on a very good knowledge of professional practice.
An example of this issue is in the multi-agency front door (the initial point of contact when someone has concerns about a child). Here, multi-agency decision-making can happen virtually or through co-location. Different agencies and professionals always have a variety of expertise. Valuing that range of expertise and difference in perspective and focus is critical. Bringing it all together leads to better decision-making.
However, simply sitting in the same room as one another is not enough. Inspectors have found instances of agencies located together but still missing opportunities to share information and make joint decisions. All agencies must understand their own and each other’s roles, no matter where they are located.
Understanding of thresholds and different roles and responsibilities across agencies remains a significant challenge across all aspects of children in need and child protection. For example, in the recent neglect JTAI some professionals were not aware of the role of community rehabilitation companies (CRC) and the national probation services (NPS). Therefore, they did not always share appropriate information or seek information about children linked to adults involved with these services. We are finding this lack of understanding of thresholds in emerging areas of concern such as ‘county lines’ and criminal exploitation.
Good systems for information sharing which professionals are confident and knowledgeable about
We are still finding examples of confusion and poor practice when it comes to information sharing. This is directly impacting on children.
Examples include:
a school that reported to an inspector that they could not share information about domestic abuse unless they had the parents’ permission
different health professionals working with older neglected children not sharing information about the same child so that each one does not have the most up-to-date information about all aspects of a child’s well-being, health and sexual health
nurses not always sharing relevant information when there are indicators of child sexual abuse
information not always being shared with CRC and NPS, and information about children linked to adults involved with these services not being requested
Better examples of information are also evident. In Hampshire, ‘IT systems ensure that agencies can access and share information. For example, multi-agency safeguarding hub (MASH) health practitioners have access to the children’s social care records. The recent facility for health services to have access to a number of GP summary care records for adults and children has been helpful, both in enhancing initial information gathering and the quality of risk assessment within the MASH.’
In Wiltshire, MASH practitioners hold a daily domestic abuse conference call to discuss domestic abuse cases and share information in a timely manner across multiple agencies.
Strong support and challenge within the multi-agency system
We know that high support and high challenge can create an environment in which practice can flourish. This includes good quality training and supervision and needs to be in place for the whole multi-agency partnership.
Building trust and confidence between partners is complex. But we have seen agencies that are able to challenge each other and professionals who understand the processes for escalating concerns about children or for challenging decisions about children. In many of these cases, we have seen better outcomes for children. This is often an indicator of a healthy partnership. In a recent JTAI, some schools told us that because they knew they understood the escalation process and knew they would be taken seriously they felt confident in challenging decisions. We saw that this made a difference for children. The three lead partners will need to think carefully about how they build that culture of healthy challenge.
The importance of independent scrutiny is summed up well in the Stockton-On-Tees JTAI report:
The LSCB has a strong and independent identity. This means that challenges to agencies that arise from the board’s monitoring and scrutiny role carry a sufficient degree of authority to ensure that the agencies respond positively and work to address areas of weaker practice.
Section 11 audits have really made a difference in terms of scrutiny and challenge when they are carried out well. They can provide good evidence about work at both strategic and practice levels and can enable agencies to be held to account. Inspectors have seen that ‘challenge days’ can make a positive difference. This is when agencies come together to discuss the findings from Section 11 audits and to be held account for taking timely and appropriate action to address any gaps in their safeguarding response.
An environment in which multi-agency practice can flourish
All the components described in this commentary lead to an environment where multi-agency practice can flourish. Building this sort of environment should be at the heart of any new arrangements.
I have already mentioned the importance of a common purpose and understanding across partner agencies. Other important ingredients for this environment are:
training and learning being multi-agency, where appropriate
multi-agency auditing and subsequent ownership and action planning
developing multi-agency tools to enable a common approach to and understanding of child protection
Cheshire West and Chester is a good example of having the right environment for multi-agency work to thrive. Its inspection report stated:
The Cheshire West Local Safeguarding Children Board (LSCB) has taken the lead in developing and promoting the use of evidence-based tools to support practice, and there is a cycle of continual review and sharpening of responses to tackle neglect. For example, learning from audit is leading to a further refinement of these tools, including the development of an assessment tool for older children. A wide range of agencies are involved in LSCB audits and the findings are widely disseminated across partner agencies, leading to improvements in practice.
Practitioners across all health services use a range of risk assessment tools provided by the LSCB, alongside specific health assessment tools, to support them in assessing the risk of neglect and to inform decisions to refer on. This was seen, in cases, to help practitioners understand the specific needs of children and the impact of neglect on children across age ranges.
Having a line of sight to practice
Multi-agency partnerships need an effective system to monitor and evaluate the impact of their work on the progress and experiences of children in their local area. They also need to act on any areas of practice that need improvement and monitor what happens next.
There needs to be a clear understanding of what is happening in frontline practice. Only then can you improve the quality of services and appropriately influence the planning and commissioning of services to help and protect children. Having a culture of scrutiny and challenge that leads to improvements in safeguarding will maintain a focus on the right issues. In our view, multi-agency audits can be a real driver of getting it right.
We know that there are points in the system where to take your eye off the ball is more risky. For example, leaders should never lose sight of the quality of referrals and decision-making at the front door. Keeping a grip on the quality of practice here is key to getting it right for children. Robust auditing activity gives senior leaders the insight that they need.
The importance of multi-agency auditing
While most areas have multi-agency audits in place, the quality is highly variable and evidence of impact as a result if not always clear. Not all partnerships are involving service user feedback in audits and not all feed back directly to staff. Therefore, learning is limited.
When multi-agency audits are done well, they enable significant insight into both individual agency practice, multi-agency practice and the impact on the lives of children and families. They act as a driver for improvement. During the JTAIs, we have found that agencies can learn as much from good practice examples as they can from identifying lessons learned from deficits in practice. Engaging staff in audits is more effective in improving practice, as is ensuring wide dissemination of the learning.
Derby uses auditing effectively to make a difference to the lives of children. When it carries out an audit and completes a review of progress, staff plan a further audit to make sure that the desired improvements happen. Derby has used this approach well when tackling the issue of neglect. When the board members recognised that improvement was happening too slowly, they acted swiftly. They more than doubled the number of training courses on neglect available and introduced a specific neglect element in mandatory multi-agency safeguarding courses. Derby then planned a further audit to assess the impact of this additional training on improving practice.
Creating a culture of continuous improvement and learning
Part of creating the right environment for multi-agency working to flourish is to create a learning culture.
A good example of this is one I am very familiar with, in Merton:
The board promotes a culture of continuous development. Learning from SCRs and learning improvement reviews is used to improve safeguarding practice and in the development of multi-agency policies. The routine and innovative use of single- and multi-agency case file audit means that the board can assure itself of the quality and impact of frontline social work practice and take decisive action to drive improvement. The collaboration of partners at both strategic and operational level allows for alerts and trends to be identified and acted on swiftly.
Multi-agency training that makes a positive difference to practice
Training helps. We think multi-agency training is even more important. Helping practitioners to have a shared understanding and be better sighted in each other’s roles can make a positive difference to frontline practice.
For example, in Wokingham we saw direct examples of multi-agency training on neglect leading to improving practice in casework with children living with neglect.
South Tyneside also has a comprehensive training offer, which the board develops through consultation and analysis. Training is evaluated to ensure that it is raising awareness and improving practice. Our report said:
The training offer is well aligned to the strategic priorities of partnerships to improve working practice in safeguarding children and improving outcomes. A strength of the workforce development group has been its merger with the training group from the Safeguarding Adults Board. This supports coordinated working on the ‘think family’ approach, especially in response to children in families in which alcohol, substance misuse, domestic abuse and mental ill health are prevalent.
In Stockton-On-Tees, we found more good learning opportunities:
[With] the LSCB conference, statement of intent, neglect training and roll-out of the evidence-based tool for identifying neglect, individual agencies are focused on enhancing the knowledge and skills of frontline staff to tackle neglect.
Recent initiatives include the local authority’s ‘topic of the month’ focus on adolescent neglect in August and September, neglect training delivered in termly forum meetings with school-designated safeguarding leads and quick awareness-raising measures, such as Cleveland police’s child neglect screensaver. Alongside the roll-out of the neglect assessment tool, the ongoing adoption of the family work model across agencies is beginning to support a sharper focus on both neglect and the lived experiences of children.
Engaging children in strategic developments.
The views and engagement of children should play a pivotal role in the work of the partnership. They should influence service developments. I would ask that as you think through how you are going to work together, you think about how the views of stakeholders can influence what you do and how you do it.
In Derby, staff have engaged children well in the process of creating and disseminating learning materials that have directly led to greater awareness and the prevention of harm, such as the short film ‘Alright Charlie’. A group of Year 6 girls used their learning from watching this film to protect themselves from harm and to provide evidence to the police that supported the successful prosecution of a perpetrator.
North Lincolnshire involves children in all areas of the board’s work, such as learning from serious case reviews. A group of children, dedicated to promoting positive emotional well-being and mental health, produced a ‘positive steps’ leaflet. They organised a conference to raise awareness of children and professionals. Children have also been at the forefront of developing the North Lincolnshire Children and Young People’s Emotional Health and Well-being Transformation Plan.
Summary
I want us to continue to debate how strategic arrangements for safeguarding children can improve multi-agency working so that children in need and their families get a joined-up, effective and proportionate response at the frontline.
As I have said before, no one agency can create an effective child protection system by itself. Only a joined-up approach at a strategic level will mean that vulnerable children receive a better response.
To test the effectiveness of strategic arrangements, we must always ask: ‘How is joint working making a positive difference to the lives and experiences of individual children and their families?’ At their very best, local arrangements show that ambitious, joined-up strategic partnership while also having a clear line of sight on practice, on the experiences of children and on the impact of that direct work.
My experience has highlighted the importance of scrutiny and challenge in partnership arrangements, for which there needs to be an independent element. I want to continue to ask the question about how independent scrutiny works best in improving multi-agency working combined with local mutual scrutiny and challenge.
We all have a responsibility to maintain a relentless focus on improving the multi-agency response to children in need of help and protection and their families. We will continue to share examples of where this has been done well, and collaborate closely with our colleagues in HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services, the Care Quality Commission and HMI Probation to monitor and raise any areas of concern. We will continue publishing our JTAI reports, which will continue to focus on multi-agency arrangements through specific themes.
‘Inspecting multi-agency safeguarding arrangements’ provides guidance on how Ofsted, the Care Quality Commission and Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary, Fire and Rescue Services inspect safeguarding arrangements.

<p>HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title=""HM Revenue and Customs"">HMRC</abbr>) today (10 July 2018) launched new and innovative technology to help more than 3 million customers renew their tax credits by 31 July.</p>

<p><abbr title=""HM Revenue and Customs"">HMRC</abbr> has developed a customer-focused service through Amazon Alexa specifically for those seeking help with their tax credits renewals.</p>

<p>Customers with Amazon Alexa-enabled devices can ask Alexa to ‘open <abbr title=""HM Revenue and Customs"">HMRC</abbr>’ and ask for help and information with a change of circumstances, payment information, or a renewal. No personal information is stored on Alexa and customers cannot renew their tax credits using Alexa.</p>

<p>It’s just one part of <abbr title=""HM Revenue and Customs"">HMRC</abbr>’s growing online services. Tech-savvy customers can also use the <abbr title=""HM Revenue and Customs"">HMRC</abbr> App on their smartphone to:</p>

<ul>
<li>renew their tax credits</li>
  <li>check their tax credits payments schedule</li>
  <li>find out how much they have earned for the year</li>
</ul>
<p>Tax credits help working families with targeted support, and more than 65,000 customers this year have already used the app to renew their tax credits, compared to 38,411 customers in 2017.</p>

<p>All online customers can now log into GOV.UK to check the progress of their renewal so they can be reassured it’s being worked on and know when they’ll hear back from <abbr title=""HM Revenue and Customs"">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Angela MacDonald, <abbr title=""HM Revenue and Customs"">HMRC</abbr>’s Director General for Customer Services, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We know our customers have hectic lives – full of interruptions and distractions – which is why <abbr title=""HM Revenue and Customs"">HMRC</abbr>’s online services are available at all times of the day and night.</p>

  <p>As the 31 July deadline for tax credits renewals approaches, customers can feel reassured that they can renew their benefits online or via the <abbr title=""HM Revenue and Customs"">HMRC</abbr> App at a time that suits them. And if they need to access help and support, Alexa can help customers find out about what to do when they receive a renewal pack, how to change their circumstances, or how to find out about payment information.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">We’ve improved our services so customers can renew their tax credits at a time that’s convenient for them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Online help and information on renewing tax credits is available on <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/browse/benefits/tax-credits"">GOV.UK</a> and via <abbr title=""HM Revenue and Customs"">HMRC</abbr>’s customer service Twitter feed <a rel=""external"" href=""https://twitter.com/HMRCcustomers"">@HMRCcustomers</a>.</p>

<p>Support is also available on the tax credits helpline (0345 300 3900).</p>

<h3 id=""further-information"">Further information</h3>

<p>The deadline for people to renew their tax credits is 31 July 2018. Failure to renew before the deadline will mean payments are stopped and customers may have to repay the money they have received since April.</p>

<p>If a customer requests further information through an SMS, the mobile phone number is stored for 6 hours and then automatically deleted.</p>

<p>Claimants can get help and information on renewing tax credits:</p>

<ul>
<li>on <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/browse/benefits/tax-credits"">GOV.UK</a>
</li>

<p>Commenting on the Joint Declaration of Peace and Friendship between Ethiopia and Eritrea signed on 9 July, Minister of State for Africa, Harriett Baldwin said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In agreeing the Joint Declaration on 9 July, Prime Minister Abiy and President Isaias have taken a momentous step towards building a lasting peace between Ethiopia and Eritrea. This historic agreement will mark the end of 20 years of conflict and greatly strengthen the political and economic ties that will benefit not just the populations of both countries but also enhance security and prosperity across the Horn of Africa.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">The UK remains a steadfast partner to the region and stands ready to provide support to both parties as they work through the details necessary to implement the agreement.  We call on other countries of the region and beyond to likewise lend their support.</p>

<p>The Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Liz Truss used a visit to several food manufacturers in Cornwall this week (12 and 13 July 2018) to unveil new figures that showed food and agricultural exports in the first quarter of 2018 were up for the fourth year in a row.</p>

<p>From January to March 2018, £175 million worth of food and agricultural goods were exported from the region around the globe, up £10 million on last year.</p>

<p>In 2017, nearly £700 million worth of Cornish food and agricultural goods were exported around the world, and the Chief Secretary  hopes that this figure will be bettered this year:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Food manufacturers in this region have made a flying start to 2018 and it’s hugely encouraging to learn, once again, that food exports are up for the first quarter of this year.</p>

  <p>Exporting boosts the earnings of a business, and the wages of local workers, it also enhances the reputation of Britain and Cornwall around the world.</p>

  <p>I want to see more people abroad enjoying a taste of Cornwall, like the magnificent clotted cream I’ve seen made during my visit.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">It is so important that local traders in this part of the world have the opportunity to increase their trade and create jobs and I’m here to learn how we can help them do this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While visiting Cornwall, the Chief Secretary was hosted by groups of businesses and also visited several food manufacturing factories.</p>

<p>The government is delivering for the South West, and the region now has the second-lowest unemployment rate of all UK regions. And this year alone employment has increased by 37,000, with a record high 2.8 million people now in work.</p>

<p>Since 2010 the government has worked hard to make sure businesses in all regions of the UK can start-up and scale-up. By cutting corporation tax we have helped encourage this, with 1.2 million more businesses starting up since 2010.</p>

<li>The Charging Infrastructure Investment Fund will support businesses to build electric vehicle charge points across the country and boost jobs in the industry.</li>
  <li>The move will make it easier for the public to own an ultra-low emission car, helping to improve air quality and protect the environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bidding has opened today for the management of the Government’s £400m Charging Infrastructure Investment Fund, marking a significant milestone in the future roll out of electric vehicles across the UK.</p>

<p>The fund will enable businesses to access the finances they need to build more charging points, making it easier and more viable for the public to make the switcher to cleaner, ultra-low emission cars.</p>

<p>The bidding process follows the launch of the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-launches-road-to-zero-strategy-to-lead-the-world-in-zero-emission-vehicle-technology"">Road to Zero Strategy</a> which sets out the government’s long term plan to have at least half of new cars be ultra-low emission by 2030 and all new cars and vans be effectively zero emissions by 2040.</p>

<p>The Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, Robert Jenrick, said:</p>

<p>“We want the UK to be a world leader when it comes to the number of electric cars on our roads. Uptake is increasing and we want the opportunity to own an electric vehicle to be available to all.</p>

<p>“But crucial to encouraging the take-up of these cars across the country is increasing people’s access to charging points. We want to scale up at pace and ensure interoperability for ease of use.</p>

<p>“This fund is a vital step in our mission to change the way we travel, create new jobs and protect our environment for future generations.</p>

<p>“This builds on our ambitions set out in The Road to Zero to encourage new homes to be built with charging-points.”</p>

Management of £400 million electric vehicles charge fund opens to bidders
Bidding opens for the management of the Government's Charging Infrastructure Investment Fund 
Published 23 July 2018
From:
HM Treasury, Infrastructure and Projects Authority, and Robert Jenrick MP
The Charging Infrastructure Investment Fund will support businesses to build electric vehicle charge points across the country and boost jobs in the industry.
The move will make it easier for the public to own an ultra-low emission car, helping to improve air quality and protect the environment.
Bidding has opened today for the management of the Government’s £400m Charging Infrastructure Investment Fund, marking a significant milestone in the future roll out of electric vehicles across the UK.
The fund will enable businesses to access the finances they need to build more charging points, making it easier and more viable for the public to make the switcher to cleaner, ultra-low emission cars.
The bidding process follows the launch of the Road to Zero Strategy which sets out the government’s long term plan to have at least half of new cars be ultra-low emission by 2030 and all new cars and vans be effectively zero emissions by 2040.
The Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, Robert Jenrick, said:
“We want the UK to be a world leader when it comes to the number of electric cars on our roads. Uptake is increasing and we want the opportunity to own an electric vehicle to be available to all.
“But crucial to encouraging the take-up of these cars across the country is increasing people’s access to charging points. We want to scale up at pace and ensure interoperability for ease of use.
“This fund is a vital step in our mission to change the way we travel, create new jobs and protect our environment for future generations.
“This builds on our ambitions set out in The Road to Zero to encourage new homes to be built with charging-points.”
The Chancellor announced at Budget 2017 the new £400 million fund to increase the rollout of electric vehicle charging points and catalyse the available financing market. The fund is made up of £200 million of government investment, which is to be matched by another £200 million from the private sector.
The Request for Proposals (RFP) published today sets out the Treasury’s requirements and the necessary information for fund managers to submit a bid. The successful fund manager will be appointed to raise and manage this investment fund on behalf of the Treasury.

<p>Education Secretary Damian Hinds has confirmed an investment of £508 million to fully fund the deal which means the main pay range for classroom teachers will increase by 3.5 per cent.</p>

<p>Responding to recommendations from the independent School Teachers’ Review Body (STRB), Education Secretary Damian Hinds said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are no great schools without great teachers and I want us to recruit and retain brilliant teachers who
are fairly rewarded for the vital work they do.</p>

  <p>Today we are announcing a fully funded pay rise of up to 3.5% - or between £800 and £1,366 – for classroom
teachers on the main pay range, 2% for those on the upper pay range and 1.5% for those in leadership
positions.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">This will mean that teaching continues to be a competitively rewarded career, and I will continue to work with
the profession, Ofsted and the unions on issues like excessive workload, professional development and
flexible working, to make sure teaching remains an attractive, fulfilling profession.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Schools will continue to determine how their staff are paid but the increases  above will be funded by government with a new teachers’ pay grant – worth £187 million in 2018/19 and £321 million in 2019/20 from the existing Department for Education budget – paid to all schools on top of their core budgets from the National Funding Formula, which has also been confirmed today.</p>

<p>In cash terms, teachers could receive a boost of between £1,184 and £1,366 to their salary, while salaries for new teachers will increase by between £802 and £1003.</p>

<p>The announcement comes as the government announces the biggest pay rise in almost 10 years for around one million public sector workers across Britain – the result of the government’s balanced approach to the economy, reducing debt while investing in public services.</p>

<p>The average gross pay for a teacher in 2017 was £38,700. The starting salary for a teacher is £22,917 outside of London and £28,660 in inner London. In addition to an annual pay award, many teachers also receive increases from promotions and responsibility allowances.</p>

<p>The Intellectual Property Office (<abbr title=""Intellectual Property Office"">IPO</abbr>) has issued new guidance as part of a cross-government and industry campaign. The campaign warns consumers of the serious dangers of fake car parts.</p>

<p>The amount of fake vehicle parts available on the market is on the rise. The European Union Intellectual Property Office (<abbr title=""European Union Intellectual Property Office"">EUIPO</abbr>) estimated that more than €2 billion is lost every year due to counterfeit tyres and batteries alone.</p>

<p>The most common fake vehicle parts worldwide include filters, brake pads, lights, wheel rims and air bags. As shown by BMW, many of these parts have direct safety implications and, if they fail, can lead to serious accidents.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">The counterfeiters aren’t choosy when it comes to selecting fakes. According to our investigations, a large number of spare parts are counterfeited in the automotive business.

Press release
Fake vehicle parts are on the rise
New government guidance warns of the dangers fake vehicle parts can have to drivers, passengers and road users.
Published 25 July 2018
From:
Intellectual Property Office
The Intellectual Property Office (IPO) has issued new guidance as part of a cross-government and industry campaign. The campaign warns consumers of the serious dangers of fake car parts.
The amount of fake vehicle parts available on the market is on the rise. The European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) estimated that more than €2 billion is lost every year due to counterfeit tyres and batteries alone.
The most common fake vehicle parts worldwide include filters, brake pads, lights, wheel rims and air bags. As shown by BMW, many of these parts have direct safety implications and, if they fail, can lead to serious accidents.

Spotting fakes isn’t easy. Here, on the right Audi shows a genuine coupling rod and on the left, is the fake product. Fake coupling rods can affect the steering capability of the vehicle.
To help combat this problem the IPO joined forces with the auto industry and trading platforms and other parts of government. Together they have launched a campaign to warn consumers about the dangers of fake vehicle parts. The collaboration has led to the Intellectual Property Office issuing new guidance. The guidance gives tips on how to avoid buying fake parts when shopping online and on the high street.
The collaboration is the most extensive of its kind to tackle fakes and includes:

<p>The government funded ‘<a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.big-ideas.org/project/ringing-remembers/"">Ringing Remembers</a>’ project aims to recruit 1,400 new bell ringers to take part in Armistice Day 2018 commemorations as the First World War Centenary programme reaches a seminal moment. The campaign is being run by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government in collaboration with Big Ideas and the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers.</p>

<p>One thousand new bell ringers have already been recruited to ring out following the traditional march past the Cenotaph and to honour the 1,400 bell ringers who lost their lives in the First World War.</p>

<p>Meeting new recruits to the project in the north-east, Lord Bourne officially launched the new Ringing Remembers badge, which will provide bell ringers with a lasting reminder of their contribution to Armistice Day 2018.</p>

<p>Faith Minister Lord Bourne said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The bell ringing community tragically saw 1,400 members lose their lives to the war effort. Their sacrifice will be honoured by our Ringing Remembers project, which will recruit the same number of bell ringers to take part in the centenary Armistice Day celebrations.</p>

  <p>One hundred years ago bell ringers across the country caught and amplified the national mood as 4 years of war came to an end.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">In remembrance of that special moment, and of the sacrifice bell ringers made during the First World War, I urge people across the nation to sign up to ‘Ringing Remembers’ and take part in Armistice Day 2018 as we honour those that gave so much to defend our freedom and liberty one hundred years ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lord Bourne’s call to action comes after the UK government, supported by the German government, invited nations across the world to participate in international bell ringing on 11 November 2018. This will mirror the moment 100 years ago when relief and emotion overtook and bells rang out across the country to celebrate Armistice.</p>

Faith Minister calls for new bell ringers as the nation readies for the First World War Centenary
Faith Minister Lord Bourne is calling on people across the nation to get involved in ‘Ringing Remembers’ as the country marks 100 years since the end of the First World War.
Published 25 July 2018
From:
Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government and Lord Bourne   of Aberystwyth
The government funded ‘Ringing Remembers’ project aims to recruit 1,400 new bell ringers to take part in Armistice Day 2018 commemorations as the First World War Centenary programme reaches a seminal moment. The campaign is being run by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government in collaboration with Big Ideas and the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers.
One thousand new bell ringers have already been recruited to ring out following the traditional march past the Cenotaph and to honour the 1,400 bell ringers who lost their lives in the First World War.
Meeting new recruits to the project in the north-east, Lord Bourne officially launched the new Ringing Remembers badge, which will provide bell ringers with a lasting reminder of their contribution to Armistice Day 2018.
Faith Minister Lord Bourne said:
The bell ringing community tragically saw 1,400 members lose their lives to the war effort. Their sacrifice will be honoured by our Ringing Remembers project, which will recruit the same number of bell ringers to take part in the centenary Armistice Day celebrations.
One hundred years ago bell ringers across the country caught and amplified the national mood as 4 years of war came to an end.
In remembrance of that special moment, and of the sacrifice bell ringers made during the First World War, I urge people across the nation to sign up to ‘Ringing Remembers’ and take part in Armistice Day 2018 as we honour those that gave so much to defend our freedom and liberty one hundred years ago.
Lord Bourne’s call to action comes after the UK government, supported by the German government, invited nations across the world to participate in international bell ringing on 11 November 2018. This will mirror the moment 100 years ago when relief and emotion overtook and bells rang out across the country to celebrate Armistice.

<p>A new UK aid package will contribute emergency food supplies for 1.4 million people in Afghanistan whose lives are at risk from a deadly drought, International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt announced on 27 July.</p>

<p>The UK is one of the first countries to support the United Nations’ appeal. Our rapid response will help import and distribute food and nutrition supplies before the situation deteriorates further.</p>

<p>UK support will help some of the poorest people who are reliant on agriculture for food and income but will struggle to survive when this year’s harvest fails in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>This UK aid package of support will provide immediate food and nutrition aid for 441,000 people who are already in a critical situation, including by distributing fortified wheat flour, fortified vegetable oil, pulses, salt and other nutritious foods to prevent malnutrition.</p>

<p>It will also support 1.4 million people until early next year by helping to replenish stockpiles of food and import high nutrient goods, which are high in essential vitamins, minerals and proteins.</p>

<p>International Development Secretary, Penny Mordaunt, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">The drought in Afghanistan is an unfolding crisis, with 1.4 million people’s lives at risk when this year’s harvest fails in a number of provinces in only a matter of weeks.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">The UK continues to stand by the government of Afghanistan and we have taken decisive action to step in early before the worst of the drought strikes to help prevent needless pain and suffering.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">We call on other countries to join this international effort to support some of the world’s most vulnerable people during what will be immensely difficult times.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The UK support is part of a response being coordinated by the United Nations and the Government of Afghanistan.  It will help prevent displacement of families who could otherwise be forced to leave their homes and communities.</p>

<p>Many of the poorest families have sold their livestock to get the small amount of money they need to buy food. Around 50,000 people have already fled to Herat City, in western Afghanistan, in a desperate search for ways to feed their families.</p>

<p>The most vulnerable people in Afghanistan have a limited ability to survive such a severe drought as a result of extreme poverty.  Families in the worst affected areas have no water to grow crops for next year and are now surviving on only one meal a day, which fails to provide the calories and nutritional content they need to survive.</p>

<h2 id=""notes-to-editors"">Notes to editors</h2>

<ul>
<li>Today’s £10 million package is a new allocation consisting of £1.44m from the existing humanitarian budget and £8.55m from the DFID Afghanistan country budget for 2018/19.</li>
  <li>It will be delivered in partnership with the World Food Programme in support of the Afghanistan Humanitarian Response Plan.</li>
  <li>Extremely low levels of rainfall coupled with a major heatwave mean that the drought in Afghanistan is now classified as ‘severe’.</li>

UK aid support for those at risk from drought in Afghanistan
New UK aid package to provide emergency food supplies for 1.4 million people 
Published 30 July 2018
From:
Department for International Development and The Rt Hon Penny Mordaunt MP
A new UK aid package will contribute emergency food supplies for 1.4 million people in Afghanistan whose lives are at risk from a deadly drought, International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt announced on 27 July.
The UK is one of the first countries to support the United Nations’ appeal. Our rapid response will help import and distribute food and nutrition supplies before the situation deteriorates further.
UK support will help some of the poorest people who are reliant on agriculture for food and income but will struggle to survive when this year’s harvest fails in the coming weeks.
This UK aid package of support will provide immediate food and nutrition aid for 441,000 people who are already in a critical situation, including by distributing fortified wheat flour, fortified vegetable oil, pulses, salt and other nutritious foods to prevent malnutrition.
It will also support 1.4 million people until early next year by helping to replenish stockpiles of food and import high nutrient goods, which are high in essential vitamins, minerals and proteins.

The UK support is part of a response being coordinated by the United Nations and the Government of Afghanistan.  It will help prevent displacement of families who could otherwise be forced to leave their homes and communities.
Many of the poorest families have sold their livestock to get the small amount of money they need to buy food. Around 50,000 people have already fled to Herat City, in western Afghanistan, in a desperate search for ways to feed their families.
The most vulnerable people in Afghanistan have a limited ability to survive such a severe drought as a result of extreme poverty.  Families in the worst affected areas have no water to grow crops for next year and are now surviving on only one meal a day, which fails to provide the calories and nutritional content they need to survive.
Notes to editors
Today’s £10 million package is a new allocation consisting of £1.44m from the existing humanitarian budget and £8.55m from the DFID Afghanistan country budget for 2018/19.
It will be delivered in partnership with the World Food Programme in support of the Afghanistan Humanitarian Response Plan.
Extremely low levels of rainfall coupled with a major heatwave mean that the drought in Afghanistan is now classified as ‘severe’.

      <div class=""govspeak"">
<p>The Environment Agency has launched a campaign to ensure North East businesses are prepared for flooding.</p>

<p>Since 1998 there has been at least one serious flood every year with businesses more likely to flood than be destroyed by fire.</p>

<p>And with recent events such as 2012’s ‘Thunder Thursday’ hitting businesses hard the Environment Agency is working with them to reduce the impact of a flood.</p>

<p>The campaign launches with an event in Yarm next week and will culminate with an event in North Shields in October.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency’s four Flood Resilience Community Engagement Officers for the region have already been in touch with more than 700 business across the region to raise awareness of flooding issues – more than 100 in Tyne and Wear, more than 500 in Durham and Darlington and more than 90 in Cleveland.</p>

<p>In Northumberland, the team worked with seven businesses during a drop-in about a potential flood scheme at Hexham Industrial Estate and 18 businesses attended a drop-in event at Prudhoe.</p>

<h3 id=""it-will-never-happen-to-me"">‘It will never happen to me’</h3>

<p>Taryn Al-mashgari, Community Engagement Officer for Tyne and Wear, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A common phrase I hear when out visiting businesses is ‘it will never happen to me’. Some aren’t even aware they are trading in an area at risk of flooding. Flooding accounts for 33% of all losses to business property. This has a huge impact on our economy.</p>

  <p>With climate change meaning extreme weather events becoming frequent and more severe in the future it’s more important than ever that businesses are prepared.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">Most businesses can save between 20% and 90% on the cost of lost stock and moveable equipment by taking action now, before winter. For every £1 spent preparing for flooding £5 is saved – this is money well spent.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>The campaign launches with a ‘Business Breakfast’ drop-in event in Yarm which takes place at Yarm Fellowship Hall between 7.30am-9am on Wednesday 22 August.</li>
</ul>
<p>Businesses can come along and talk to Sarah Duffy, Community Engagement Officer for Cleveland, about their experiences of flooding and she will be helping them understand how to prepare for a flood, create a business flood group and ensure the safety of staff and customers during a flood event. Refreshments will be provided.</p>

<ul>
<li>This will be followed up by a community drop-in event at Redcar and Cleveland Leisure and Community Heart on Friday 24 August between 10am and 12noon.</li>
</ul>
<p>And in October, the campaign will culminate with a big event for businesses at North Shields Fish Quay. Taryn added:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">The impact of ‘Thunder Thursday’ on businesses across the country was estimated to be £200million, that’s an extraordinary figure. There’s lots that businesses can do to reduce the impact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Things businesses can do to make them more resilient to flooding:</p>

<ol>
<li>
    <p>Understand the different types of flooding. Flooding can happen from the coast, river, surface water, sewer and groundwater.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Check their flood risk. Businesses can check if they are at risk of flooding from rivers, the coast and surface water.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Check they have the right level of insurance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Write a flood plan.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Invest in flood protection measures and link up with neighbouring properties.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

Press release
Make it your business to be flood resilient
The Environment Agency is working with North East businesses to ensure they are prepared for flooding. 
Published 17 August 2018
From:
Environment Agency
Taryn Al-mashgari from the Environment Agency
The Environment Agency has launched a campaign to ensure North East businesses are prepared for flooding.
Since 1998 there has been at least one serious flood every year with businesses more likely to flood than be destroyed by fire.
And with recent events such as 2012’s ‘Thunder Thursday’ hitting businesses hard the Environment Agency is working with them to reduce the impact of a flood.
The campaign launches with an event in Yarm next week and will culminate with an event in North Shields in October.
The Environment Agency’s four Flood Resilience Community Engagement Officers for the region have already been in touch with more than 700 business across the region to raise awareness of flooding issues – more than 100 in Tyne and Wear, more than 500 in Durham and Darlington and more than 90 in Cleveland.
In Northumberland, the team worked with seven businesses during a drop-in about a potential flood scheme at Hexham Industrial Estate and 18 businesses attended a drop-in event at Prudhoe.
‘It will never happen to me’
Taryn Al-mashgari, Community Engagement Officer for Tyne and Wear, said:
A common phrase I hear when out visiting businesses is ‘it will never happen to me’. Some aren’t even aware they are trading in an area at risk of flooding. Flooding accounts for 33% of all losses to business property. This has a huge impact on our economy.
With climate change meaning extreme weather events becoming frequent and more severe in the future it’s more important than ever that businesses are prepared.
Most businesses can save between 20% and 90% on the cost of lost stock and moveable equipment by taking action now, before winter. For every £1 spent preparing for flooding £5 is saved – this is money well spent.
The campaign launches with a ‘Business Breakfast’ drop-in event in Yarm which takes place at Yarm Fellowship Hall between 7.30am-9am on Wednesday 22 August.
Businesses can come along and talk to Sarah Duffy, Community Engagement Officer for Cleveland, about their experiences of flooding and she will be helping them understand how to prepare for a flood, create a business flood group and ensure the safety of staff and customers during a flood event. Refreshments will be provided.
This will be followed up by a community drop-in event at Redcar and Cleveland Leisure and Community Heart on Friday 24 August between 10am and 12noon.
And in October, the campaign will culminate with a big event for businesses at North Shields Fish Quay. Taryn added:
The impact of ‘Thunder Thursday’ on businesses across the country was estimated to be £200million, that’s an extraordinary figure. There’s lots that businesses can do to reduce the impact.
Things businesses can do to make them more resilient to flooding:
Understand the different types of flooding. Flooding can happen from the coast, river, surface water, sewer and groundwater.
Check their flood risk. Businesses can check if they are at risk of flooding from rivers, the coast and surface water.
Check they have the right level of insurance.
Write a flood plan.
Invest in flood protection measures and link up with neighbouring properties.

<p>35,000 drivers a day are benefiting from the major upgrade on the A21 linking Hastings and London, between Tonbridge and Pembury in Kent, which was officially opened on 21 September last year.</p>

Press release
Marking 12 months of the new Tonbridge to Pembury bypass
One year ago today, Highways England opened the new A21 Tonbridge to Pembury Bypass. 
Published 24 September 2018
From:
Highways England
35,000 drivers a day are benefiting from the major upgrade on the A21 linking Hastings and London, between Tonbridge and Pembury in Kent, which was officially opened on 21 September last year.
The upgrade to this busy section introduced a new dual carriageway to speed up journeys, improve safety, reduce congestion and boost the economy. Two new junctions were built, as well as better, safer, access to the A21 for the homes and businesses along it, with dedicated new facilities for pedestrians, cyclists and equestrians.
And residents are delighted with how much of a difference the new bypass has made. Melvyn, who has lived in the area for 34 years, said that the new bypass is his “favourite bit of road - it was terrible before but now it is absolutely brilliant!”.
Jade, who has lived in the area for four years, said:
It was dreadful before. But now, a journey that used to take me forty minutes now takes four.
And Siobhan who has lived locally all her life, said:
the road was awful before. It has massively improved the flow of the traffic and it has made my commute a lot nicer.
Local businessman Mark Chapman of Gillman Car Services, said:
From a business transport perspective it’s made life an awful lot better, it really has improved things… It’s easier, it’s quicker and frankly it’s prettier.
Local people have been making use of the shared use path which runs the full length of the scheme. This is also suitable for cyclists, horse riders and pedestrians. Working with Kent County Council, Highways England extended it to tie in with Tonbridge railway station at the north end of the scheme and Pembury hospital at the south, making it even more useful to residents, commuters and the local community.

It’s not just the improvements to the A21 which have benefitted the communities and road users this past year. 18 hectares of new woodland have been created as part of the project – twice that needed for construction - with cutting edge translocation techniques, to preserve its ecological make up. New areas of heathland have been created and an ancient barn has been carefully taken down, restored and reconstructed at a heritage museum.
Putting the May Day Barn back at the heart of the community
One of the South East’s few surviving timber framed barns, built originally in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, has been restored as part of a multi-million conservation project thanks to funding from Highways England.
The buildings were in the path of the widening scheme of the Tonbridge to Pembury section of the A21 in Kent, so were painstakingly moved and rebuilt at the Weald and Downland Museum.
Simon Elliott, Highways England construction programme manager said:
I am delighted that these much-needed improvements to the A21 are delivering such a wide rage of benefits, significantly improving journeys on this busy road and making life easier for cyclists, pedestrians and horse riders while simultaneously respecting the environment and our cultural heritage. We will look to take the same approach with the other road upgrades we are delivering in Kent and across the country.
One of the timber framed barns, originally in the path of the new Tonbridge to Pembury bypass, which has been moved to the Weald and Downland Living museumWork started on the Tonbridge to Pembury bypass in spring 2015. The new road opened in phases, starting with the new flyover at Longfield Road, which partially opened in July 2017.

<h3 id=""introduction"">Introduction</h3>

<p>Chief Secretary, distinguished guests, Lords, ladies, gentleman, it is a pleasure to address you this evening.</p>

<p>As a finance minister, I am often told to keep things small, not big.</p>

<p>As the Minister responsible for taxation, I look to Hong Kong for inspiration.</p>

<p>Because your tax code is 270 pages. Our is 17,000.</p>

<p>So I have some lessons to learn!</p>

<h3 id=""one-country-two-systems"">One Country, Two Systems</h3>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, over twenty years ago Deng Xiaoping and Margaret Thatcher agreed the principle of “One Country, Two Systems” …</p>

<p>…a structure designed to protect Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy, independent judiciary, rule of law, and rights and freedoms of its residents and others in the Special Administrative Region.</p>

<p>And at the time, of course, it was not without its critics…</p>

<p>…many people felt a sense of trepidation about what was to come…</p>

<p>…with some prophesising a highly regulated economy or indeed, even economic decline.</p>

<p>But the critics have been proved wrong, and Hong Kong has indeed stood the test of time.</p>

<p>“One Country, Two Systems” has protected the success of Hong Kong…</p>

<p>…and it is vital that this continues…</p>

<p>…as part of the faithful implementation of the Joint Declaration.</p>

<p>More than ever, Hong Kong has been characterised by strength and prosperity.</p>

<p>Today it stands as one of the most thriving and energetic cities in the world…</p>

<p>…like London, a global financial powerhouse…</p>

<p>…and the gateway to China – one of the biggest markets in the world.</p>

<p>And more than ever, we should perhaps reflect on Hong Kong’s legacy…</p>

<p>…and take on board the lessons of history.</p>

<p>Because in the immortal words of Mark Twain, history doesn’t repeat itself – but it does rhyme.</p>

<p>As the UK prepares to the leave the European Union…</p>

<p>…to face the world …</p>

<p>…we acknowledge that we will always be a part of Europe…</p>

<p>…but we are ready to take control of our future…</p>

<p>…as a sovereign nation, as Global Britain.</p>

<p>Just as Hong Kong challenged the naysayers all those years ago…</p>

<p>…our country has the chance to do precisely the same.</p>

<p>The ties that bind us together</p>

<p>Chief Secretary, by geographic fate, the UK and Hong Kong stand as lighthouses in our regions…</p>

<p>…bordered by sea, gateways to commerce, with a shared history of entrepreneurship.</p>

<p>But geo-politics is not the only thing that binds us…</p>

<p>… because we both share certain special qualities.</p>

<p>We are filled with a sense of determination, of adventure, and in our economic affairs – an unwavering commitment to cross-border trade.</p>

<p>These are qualities that will allow the UK and Hong Kong to survive the turbulence of the 21st century…</p>

<p>…and grasp the opportunities it undoubtedly presents. 
And, as the UK faces a time of unprecedented change in her history, we are looking to our international partners…</p>

<p>…and especially to those with which we have deep historic ties.</p>

<p>The enduring relationship between the UK and Hong Kong has its foundation in a shared history…</p>

<p>…but it has grown into so much more than that.</p>

<p>Just look at the 300,000 British citizens resident in Hong Kong…</p>

<p>…to the tens of thousands of Hong Kong students who study in the UK every year…</p>

<p>…to the British Council’s Festival of Ideas next January – which will showcase the best of UK creativity and innovations.</p>

<p>So, we have a strong base of shared values…</p>

<p>…and a legacy of exchange – be it of ideas, culture or people.</p>

<p>But as a Treasury Minister, it is the continued strength of our economies…</p>

<p>…and the two-way flow of trade and investment upon which I want to focus on this evening.</p>

<h3 id=""tapping-into-new-markets-together"">Tapping into new markets together</h3>

<p>Our two great economies are deeply intertwined…</p>

<p>…Hong Kong remains the UK’s second largest export market for goods in the APAC region…</p>

<p>…investment from Hong Kong into the UK has increased by 35% since 2010…</p>

<p>…and Hong Kong is home to over a third of all British investment in Asia.</p>

<p>And as we leave the European Union, we will look to further enhance our partnership with Hong Kong.
Because despite appearances, no financial centre is an island…</p>

<p>…both the UK and Hong Kong are leading global hubs…</p>

<p>…in facilitating trade and prosperity throughout Europe, Asia and beyond.</p>

<p>And we are stronger when working together.</p>

<p>Through the annual London-Hong Kong Financial Forum, we have committed to explore and capitalise on the issues facing our financial industries.</p>

<p>It is only by harnessing the forces set to reshape financial markets – rather than avoiding them – that we can continue the UK and HK’s mutually beneficial relationship.</p>

<p>Globalisation, climate change, infrastructure, technology…</p>

<p>…should be taken and acknowledged for what they are…</p>

<p>…as opportunities to seize.</p>

<p>Take for example the untapped potential of green finance…</p>

<p>…and the role it could play in funding 21st century corporates…</p>

<p>…and facilitating infrastructure projects worldwide.</p>

<p>In Asia – this could range from the Greater Bay Area to the trans-continental Belt and Road Initiative…</p>

<p>…and here at home, I am proud to see green finance being put to use as we build the UK’s Northern Powerhouse.</p>

<p>Green finance has the potential to be a rapidly expanding force of financing.</p>

<p>To meet the infrastructure needs of developing Asian economies would require $1.5 trillion in investment per year until 2030.</p>

<p>We should all rise to the challenge as to how green finance can be targeted to plug that gap.</p>

<p>This vision will only be attained if leading financial centres – like London and Hong Kong – work in tandem to scale-up the sector…</p>

<p>…and foster the right environment for a competitive green marketplace to emerge.</p>

<p>Green finance of course is but one area of innovation that the UK and Hong Kong can capitalise on.</p>

<p>At this dinner last year, the UK-Hong Kong FinTech Bridge was witnessed by the Chief Executive and the Chancellor of the Exchequer…</p>

<p>…to enhance connectivity…</p>

<p>…pool our mutual expertise…</p>

<p>…and permit our firms to access the capital, talent, accelerators and start-ups in both jurisdictions.</p>

<p>The bridge that extends between us will apply cutting-edge technology to turbo-charge our financial industries.</p>

<p>I am a great believer that FinTech has enormous power to transform international finance…</p>

<p>…and create a more efficient, productive and bespoke industry for corporates and consumers.</p>

<p>So I am thrilled that the UK and Hong Kong remain at the frontier of this sector.</p>

<p>In the months and years ahead, green finance and FinTech are but two aspects of an ambitious bilateral agenda.</p>

<p>I welcome the Chief Executive’s support of our Strategic Dialogue on Trade Partnership…</p>

<p>…which gives us a way to identify and address any remaining barriers to trade between the UK and Hong Kong.</p>

<p>And we are preparing for the 8th London-Hong Kong Financial Forum…</p>

<p>…working to ensure corporates and investors can access new opportunities…</p>

<p>…and delivering the innovation and thought leadership necessary to meet challenges bigger than any one financial centre.</p>

<p>Because the joint investment opportunities are vast – just take the rise of China.</p>

<p>It is expected that up to $600 billion in foreign funds will enter the Chinese stock market in the next 5 – 10 years…</p>

<p>…channelled through Stock Connects that are operational in Hong Kong…</p>

<p>…and soon to launch in London.</p>

<p>Already around 60% of all Chinese capital flows through Hong Kong…</p>

<p>…often hiring UK professional services firms as intermediaries and advisers.</p>

<p>The opportunities to fully explore the potential of investment in China …</p>

<p>…is something we should both consider a priority in the years ahead.</p>

<p>I know I speak on behalf of the Chancellor and the Government when I say that we are committed to exploring the synergies between Hong Kong and Global Britain…</p>

<p>…collaborating to bring us both greater prosperity and competitiveness.</p>

<h3 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h3>

<p>So, to conclude this evening, I want to share this quote with you:</p>

<p>“Britain must always think and act internationally. But rather than rely on our influence within the confines of a narrow Europe I would have us fulfil our destiny as a nation with global interests and a special understanding of the world derived from our history.”</p>

<p>That was Margaret Thatcher speaking in Asia before the handover of Hong Kong in 1997.</p>

<p>And her words have never been more relevant.</p>

<p>As we prepare to face the world as Global Britain, eager to embrace the opportunities this country voted to explore…</p>

<p>…we are looking beyond Europe; we are looking East.</p>

<p>There has never been a better time to unlock the full potential of our relationship with Hong Kong, a natural ally in the East.</p>

Speech
FST speech to the Hong Kong Trade Development Council Dinner: 27 September 2018
Mel Stride delivered a speech on the relevance and potential of the UK-Hong Kong relationship.
Published 28 September 2018
From:
HM Treasury and The Rt Hon Mel Stride MP
Delivered on: 
27 September 2018 (Transcript of the speech, exactly as it was delivered)
Introduction
Chief Secretary, distinguished guests, Lords, ladies, gentleman, it is a pleasure to address you this evening.
As a finance minister, I am often told to keep things small, not big.
As the Minister responsible for taxation, I look to Hong Kong for inspiration.
Because your tax code is 270 pages. Our is 17,000.
So I have some lessons to learn!
One Country, Two Systems
Ladies and gentlemen, over twenty years ago Deng Xiaoping and Margaret Thatcher agreed the principle of “One Country, Two Systems” …
…a structure designed to protect Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy, independent judiciary, rule of law, and rights and freedoms of its residents and others in the Special Administrative Region.
And at the time, of course, it was not without its critics…
…many people felt a sense of trepidation about what was to come…
…with some prophesising a highly regulated economy or indeed, even economic decline.
But the critics have been proved wrong, and Hong Kong has indeed stood the test of time.
“One Country, Two Systems” has protected the success of Hong Kong…
…and it is vital that this continues…
…as part of the faithful implementation of the Joint Declaration.
More than ever, Hong Kong has been characterised by strength and prosperity.
Today it stands as one of the most thriving and energetic cities in the world…
…like London, a global financial powerhouse…
…and the gateway to China – one of the biggest markets in the world.
And more than ever, we should perhaps reflect on Hong Kong’s legacy…
…and take on board the lessons of history.
Because in the immortal words of Mark Twain, history doesn’t repeat itself – but it does rhyme.
As the UK prepares to the leave the European Union…
…to face the world …
…we acknowledge that we will always be a part of Europe…
…but we are ready to take control of our future…
…as a sovereign nation, as Global Britain.
Just as Hong Kong challenged the naysayers all those years ago…
…our country has the chance to do precisely the same.
The ties that bind us together
Chief Secretary, by geographic fate, the UK and Hong Kong stand as lighthouses in our regions…
…bordered by sea, gateways to commerce, with a shared history of entrepreneurship.
But geo-politics is not the only thing that binds us…
… because we both share certain special qualities.
We are filled with a sense of determination, of adventure, and in our economic affairs – an unwavering commitment to cross-border trade.
These are qualities that will allow the UK and Hong Kong to survive the turbulence of the 21st century…
…and grasp the opportunities it undoubtedly presents. 
And, as the UK faces a time of unprecedented change in her history, we are looking to our international partners…
…and especially to those with which we have deep historic ties.
The enduring relationship between the UK and Hong Kong has its foundation in a shared history…
…but it has grown into so much more than that.
Just look at the 300,000 British citizens resident in Hong Kong…
…to the tens of thousands of Hong Kong students who study in the UK every year…
…to the British Council’s Festival of Ideas next January – which will showcase the best of UK creativity and innovations.
So, we have a strong base of shared values…
…and a legacy of exchange – be it of ideas, culture or people.
But as a Treasury Minister, it is the continued strength of our economies…
…and the two-way flow of trade and investment upon which I want to focus on this evening.
Tapping into new markets together
Our two great economies are deeply intertwined…
…Hong Kong remains the UK’s second largest export market for goods in the APAC region…
…investment from Hong Kong into the UK has increased by 35% since 2010…
…and Hong Kong is home to over a third of all British investment in Asia.
And as we leave the European Union, we will look to further enhance our partnership with Hong Kong.
Because despite appearances, no financial centre is an island…
…both the UK and Hong Kong are leading global hubs…
…in facilitating trade and prosperity throughout Europe, Asia and beyond.
And we are stronger when working together.
Through the annual London-Hong Kong Financial Forum, we have committed to explore and capitalise on the issues facing our financial industries.
It is only by harnessing the forces set to reshape financial markets – rather than avoiding them – that we can continue the UK and HK’s mutually beneficial relationship.
Globalisation, climate change, infrastructure, technology…
…should be taken and acknowledged for what they are…
…as opportunities to seize.
Take for example the untapped potential of green finance…
…and the role it could play in funding 21st century corporates…
…and facilitating infrastructure projects worldwide.
In Asia – this could range from the Greater Bay Area to the trans-continental Belt and Road Initiative…
…and here at home, I am proud to see green finance being put to use as we build the UK’s Northern Powerhouse.
Green finance has the potential to be a rapidly expanding force of financing.
To meet the infrastructure needs of developing Asian economies would require $1.5 trillion in investment per year until 2030.
We should all rise to the challenge as to how green finance can be targeted to plug that gap.
This vision will only be attained if leading financial centres – like London and Hong Kong – work in tandem to scale-up the sector…
…and foster the right environment for a competitive green marketplace to emerge.
Green finance of course is but one area of innovation that the UK and Hong Kong can capitalise on.
At this dinner last year, the UK-Hong Kong FinTech Bridge was witnessed by the Chief Executive and the Chancellor of the Exchequer…
…to enhance connectivity…
…pool our mutual expertise…
…and permit our firms to access the capital, talent, accelerators and start-ups in both jurisdictions.
The bridge that extends between us will apply cutting-edge technology to turbo-charge our financial industries.
I am a great believer that FinTech has enormous power to transform international finance…
…and create a more efficient, productive and bespoke industry for corporates and consumers.
So I am thrilled that the UK and Hong Kong remain at the frontier of this sector.
In the months and years ahead, green finance and FinTech are but two aspects of an ambitious bilateral agenda.
I welcome the Chief Executive’s support of our Strategic Dialogue on Trade Partnership…
…which gives us a way to identify and address any remaining barriers to trade between the UK and Hong Kong.
And we are preparing for the 8th London-Hong Kong Financial Forum…
…working to ensure corporates and investors can access new opportunities…
…and delivering the innovation and thought leadership necessary to meet challenges bigger than any one financial centre.
Because the joint investment opportunities are vast – just take the rise of China.
It is expected that up to $600 billion in foreign funds will enter the Chinese stock market in the next 5 – 10 years…
…channelled through Stock Connects that are operational in Hong Kong…
…and soon to launch in London.
Already around 60% of all Chinese capital flows through Hong Kong…
…often hiring UK professional services firms as intermediaries and advisers.
The opportunities to fully explore the potential of investment in China …
…is something we should both consider a priority in the years ahead.
I know I speak on behalf of the Chancellor and the Government when I say that we are committed to exploring the synergies between Hong Kong and Global Britain…
…collaborating to bring us both greater prosperity and competitiveness.
Conclusion
So, to conclude this evening, I want to share this quote with you:
“Britain must always think and act internationally. But rather than rely on our influence within the confines of a narrow Europe I would have us fulfil our destiny as a nation with global interests and a special understanding of the world derived from our history.”
That was Margaret Thatcher speaking in Asia before the handover of Hong Kong in 1997.
And her words have never been more relevant.
As we prepare to face the world as Global Britain, eager to embrace the opportunities this country voted to explore…
…we are looking beyond Europe; we are looking East.
There has never been a better time to unlock the full potential of our relationship with Hong Kong, a natural ally in the East.
I look forward to strengthening the bonds between us…
…for the years to come.
Thank you all very much.

<p>The extra funding, announced by Secretary of State for Health and Social Care Matt Hancock, is aimed at reducing delayed transfers of care and will be allocated to councils based on the adult social care relative needs formula.</p>

<p>The money could pay for one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>more than 71,500 home care packages to help patients get out of hospital quicker</li>
  <li>86,500 reablement packages, which support workers to help patients carry out everyday tasks and regain mobility and confidence</li>
  <li>nearly 27,000 home adaptations, including new facilities for personal care, such as adapting a shower room if a patient has limited movement</li>
</ul>
<p>The funding brings total government investment in the health and care system over winter to more than £420 million, which includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>
    <p>£145 million given to the NHS in September to boost winter resilience, which will go toward upgrading wards, redeveloping A&amp;E departments and paying for an extra 900 beds</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>£36.3 million awarded to ambulance trusts in June to prepare for the colder months, which will go towards buying 256 new state-of-the-art ambulances</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>As announced in last year’s budget, an additional £1.6 billion has been given to the service for 2018 to 2019. This investment will be used by the NHS to treat a quarter of a million more patients in A&amp;E and to improve A&amp;E performance.</p>

<p>Other actions being taken to boost support over the winter include:</p>

<ul>
<li>ensuring extended access in primary care is in place across the country, with an additional 9 million appointments per year</li>
  <li>rolling out NHS 111 Online nationwide</li>
  <li>taking action to safely reduce ambulances conveying patients to hospital through increased ‘hear and treat’ and ‘see and treat’</li>
  <li>expanding the provision of ‘same day’ emergency care</li>
  <li>setting an ambition to reduced long stays in hospital (over 21 days) by 25% to free up 4,000 beds</li>
</ul>
<p>NHS leaders have also announced an ambition for all frontline workers to get the flu jab to protect patients as part of a comprehensive plan for this winter.</p>

<p>Matt Hancock said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to help the NHS through this winter.</p>

  <p>I have already provided funding for hospitals to make upgrades to their buildings to deal with pressures this winter, and I can announce that today I am making an extra £240 million available to councils to pay for social care packages this winter to support our NHS.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">We will use this money to get people who don’t need to be in hospital, but do need care, back home, back into their communities, so we can free up those vital hospital beds, and help people who really need it, get the hospital care they need.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simon Stevens, NHS England Chief Executive, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Helping patients go home when they are ready is vital to easing pressure on the NHS, particularly busy A&amp;E departments.</p>

  <p>So, as the government develops a comprehensive social care funding solution, hospitals will rightly welcome this targeted funding to ease pressures on the NHS this winter by paying for extra care packages and care home places for frail older people.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">Over the past 18 months, the NHS and councils have worked together to cut delayed discharges, freeing up 4 hospitals-worth of beds across England. This money will allow councils to build on that progress.</p>

£240 million social care investment to ease NHS winter pressures

New measures announced to combat forced marriage
The Home Secretary Sajid Javid has announced a package of measures to tackle the appalling crime of forced marriage.
Published 2 October 2018
From:
Home Office and The Rt Hon Sajid Javid MP
As part of this, a public consultation will be launched to determine whether there should be a mandatory requirement for professionals to report a forced marriage case to the authorities. This will help identify:
which professionals the duty would apply to
the specific circumstances where a case would have to be reported
potential sanctions for failure to comply with the duty
Further measures announced today to crack down on forced marriage include plans to:
consult on including an explicit reference to forced marriage in the immigration rules to demonstrate that forced marriage is unacceptable in the UK
launch a communications campaign to raise awareness of the issue
work with the judiciary to examine whether anonymous evidence of forced marriage can be admissible as closed evidence in the appeals process
consult on updated multi-agency statutory guidance on forced marriage to help ensure professionals understand forced marriage and their responsibilities
This work will progress over the coming months and follows previous action taken by the government to strengthen the law including the introduction of a specific criminal offence of forced marriage, lifelong anonymity for victims, and criminalising breach of a Forced Marriage Protection Order (FMPO).

<p>During September, there were two new detentions of foreign flagged vessels in a UK port, three vessels remained under detention from previous months. A total of three vessels remain under detention at the end of September.</p>

<ol>
<li>
    <p>In response to one of the recommendations of Lord Donaldson’s inquiry into the prevention of pollution from merchant shipping, and in compliance with the EU Directive on Port State Control (2009/16/EC as amended), the Maritime and Coastguard agency (MCA) publishes details of the foreign flagged vessels detained in UK ports each month.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The UK is part of a regional agreement on port state control known as the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control (Paris MOU) and information on all ships that are inspected is held centrally in an electronic database known as THETIS. This allows the ships with a high risk rating and poor detention records to be targeted for future inspection.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inspections of foreign flagged ships in UK ports are undertaken by surveyors from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. When a ship is found to be not in compliance with applicable convention requirements, a deficiency may be raised. If any of their deficiencies are so serious they have to be rectified before departure, then the ship will be detained.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All deficiencies should be rectified before departure if at all possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When applicable, the list includes those passenger craft prevented from operating under the provisions of the EU Directive on Mandatory Surveys for the safe operation of regular Ro-Ro ferry and high speed passenger craft services (1999/35/EU).</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Notes on the list of detentions</p>

<ul>
<li>Full details of the ship.
The accompanying detention list shows ship’s International Maritime Organization (IMO) number which is unchanging throughout the ship’s life and uniquely identifies it. It also shows the ship’s name and flag state at the time of its inspection.</li>
  <li>Company.
The company shown in the vessel’s Safety Management Certificate (SMC) or if there is no SMC, then the party otherwise believed to be responsible for the safety of the ship at the time of inspection.</li>
  <li>Classification Society.
The list shows the Classification Society responsible for classing the ship only.</li>
  <li>Recognised Organisation.
Responsible for conducting the statutory surveys: and issuing statutory certificates on behalf of the Flag State</li>
  <li>White (WL), Grey (GL) and Black lists (BL) are issued by the Paris MoU on 01 July each year and shows the performance of flag State.</li>

Press release
Foreign flagged ships detained in the UK during September 2018
The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) announced today that Five foreign flagged ships were under detention in UK ports during September 2018 after failing Port State Control (PSC) inspection.
Published 11 October 2018
From:
Maritime and Coastguard Agency
During September, there were two new detentions of foreign flagged vessels in a UK port, three vessels remained under detention from previous months. A total of three vessels remain under detention at the end of September.
In response to one of the recommendations of Lord Donaldson’s inquiry into the prevention of pollution from merchant shipping, and in compliance with the EU Directive on Port State Control (2009/16/EC as amended), the Maritime and Coastguard agency (MCA) publishes details of the foreign flagged vessels detained in UK ports each month.
The UK is part of a regional agreement on port state control known as the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control (Paris MOU) and information on all ships that are inspected is held centrally in an electronic database known as THETIS. This allows the ships with a high risk rating and poor detention records to be targeted for future inspection.
Inspections of foreign flagged ships in UK ports are undertaken by surveyors from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. When a ship is found to be not in compliance with applicable convention requirements, a deficiency may be raised. If any of their deficiencies are so serious they have to be rectified before departure, then the ship will be detained.
All deficiencies should be rectified before departure if at all possible.
When applicable, the list includes those passenger craft prevented from operating under the provisions of the EU Directive on Mandatory Surveys for the safe operation of regular Ro-Ro ferry and high speed passenger craft services (1999/35/EU).
Notes on the list of detentions
Full details of the ship.
The accompanying detention list shows ship’s International Maritime Organization (IMO) number which is unchanging throughout the ship’s life and uniquely identifies it. It also shows the ship’s name and flag state at the time of its inspection.
Company.
The company shown in the vessel’s Safety Management Certificate (SMC) or if there is no SMC, then the party otherwise believed to be responsible for the safety of the ship at the time of inspection.
Classification Society.
The list shows the Classification Society responsible for classing the ship only.
Recognised Organisation.
Responsible for conducting the statutory surveys: and issuing statutory certificates on behalf of the Flag State

      <div class=""govspeak"">
<p>With permission Mr Speaker, I would like to update the House ahead of this week’s European Council.</p>

<p>We are entering the final stages of these negotiations.</p>

<p>This is the time for cool, calm heads to prevail.</p>

<p>And it is the time for a clear-eyed focus on the few remaining but critical issues that are still to be agreed.</p>

<p>Yesterday the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union went to Brussels for further talks with Michel Barnier.</p>

<p>There has inevitably been a great deal of inaccurate speculation.</p>

<p>So, I want to set out clearly for the House, the facts as they stand.</p>

<p>First, we have made real progress in recent weeks on both the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration on our future relationship.</p>

<p>And I want to pay tribute to both negotiating teams for the many, many hours of hard work that have got us to this point.</p>

<p>In March, we agreed legal text around the implementation period, citizens’ rights and the financial settlement.</p>

<p>And we have now made good progress on text concerning the majority of the outstanding issues.</p>

<p>Taken together, the shape of a deal across the vast majority of the withdrawal agreement - the terms of our exit - are now clear.</p>

<p>We also have broad agreement on the structure and scope of the framework for our future relationship, with progress on issues like security, transport and services.</p>

<p>And perhaps, most significantly, we have made progress on Northern Ireland – where, Mr Speaker, the EU have been working with us to respond to the very real concerns we had on their original proposals.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker, let me remind the House why this is so important.</p>

<p>Both the UK and the EU share a profound responsibility to ensure the preservation of the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, protecting the hard won peace and stability in Northern Ireland and ensuring that life continues essentially as it does now.</p>

<p>We agree that our future economic partnership should provide for solutions to the unique circumstances in Northern Ireland in the long term.</p>

<p>And, while we are both committed to ensuring that this future relationship is in place by the end of the implementation period, we accept that there is a chance that there may be a gap between the two.</p>

<p>This is what creates the need for a backstop to ensure that, if such a temporary gap were ever to arise, there would be no hard-border between Northern Ireland and Ireland – or indeed anything that would threaten the integrity of our precious union.</p>

<p>So this backstop is intended to be an insurance policy for people of Northern Ireland and Ireland.</p>

<p>Previously, the European Union had proposed a backstop that would see Northern Ireland carved-off in the EU’s customs union and parts of the single market, separated through a border in the Irish Sea from the UK’s own internal market.</p>

<p>As I have said many times, I could never accept that, no matter how unlikely such a scenario may be.</p>

<p>Creating any form of customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK would mean a fundamental change in the day-to-day experience for businesses in Northern Ireland – with the potential to affect jobs and investment.</p>

<p>We published our proposals on customs in the backstop in June, and after Salzburg, I said we would bring forward our own further proposals – and that is what we have done in these negotiations.</p>

<p>And the European Union have responded positively by agreeing to explore a UK-wide customs solution to this backstop.</p>

<p>But Mr Speaker, two problems remain.</p>

<p>First, the EU says there is not time to work out the detail of this UK-wide solution in the next few weeks.</p>

<p>So even with the progress we have made, the EU still requires a “backstop to the backstop” – effectively an insurance policy for the insurance policy.</p>

<p>And they want this to be the Northern Ireland-only solution that they had previously proposed.</p>

<p>We have been clear that we cannot agree to anything that threatens the integrity of our United Kingdom.</p>

<p>And I am sure the whole House shares the government’s view on this.</p>

<p>Indeed, the House of Commons set out its view when agreeing unanimously part 6, section 55 of the Taxation (Cross-border Trade Act) on a single United Kingdom customs territory.</p>

<p>This states:</p>

<p>“It shall be unlawful for Her Majesty’s Government to enter into arrangements under which Northern Ireland forms part of a separate customs territory to Great Britain.”</p>

<p>So, Mr Speaker, this message is clear – not just from this government, but from this whole House.</p>

<p>Second, Mr Speaker, I need to be able to look the British people in the eye and say this backstop is a temporary solution.</p>

<p>People are rightly concerned that what is only meant to be temporary could become a permanent limbo – with no new relationship between the UK and the EU ever agreed.</p>

<p>I am clear we are not going to be trapped permanently in a single customs territory unable to do meaningful trade deals.</p>

<p>So it must be the case, first, that the backstop should not need to come into force.</p>

<p>Second, that if it does, it must be temporary.</p>

<p>And third – while I do not believe this will be the case - if the EU were not to co-operate on our future relationship, we must be able to ensure that we cannot be kept in this backstop arrangement indefinitely.</p>

<p>I would not expect this House to agree to a deal unless we have the reassurance that the UK, as a sovereign nation, has this say over our arrangements with the EU.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker, I do not believe the UK and the EU are far apart.</p>

<p>We both agree that Article 50 cannot provide the legal basis for a permanent relationship.</p>

<p>And we both agree this backstop must be temporary.</p>

<p>So we must now work together to give effect to that agreement.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker, so much of these negotiations are necessarily technical.</p>

<p>But the reason this all matters is because it affects the future of our country.</p>

<p>It affects jobs and livelihoods in every community. It is about what kind of country we are and about our faith in our democracy.</p>

<p>Of course, it is frustrating that almost all of the remaining points of disagreement are focused on how we manage a scenario which both sides hope should never come to pass – and which if it does, will only be temporary.</p>

<p>We cannot let this disagreement derail the prospects of a good deal and leave us with the no deal outcome that no-one wants.</p>

<p>I continue to believe that a negotiated deal is the best outcome for the UK and for the European Union.</p>

<p>I continue to believe that such a deal is achievable.</p>

<p>And that is the spirit in which I will continue to work with our European partners.</p>

<p>And I commend this Statement to the House.</p>

Oral statement to Parliament
PM statement on Brexit: 15 October 2018
Prime Minister Theresa May updates the House of Commons on the Brexit negotiations 
Published 15 October 2018
From:
Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Theresa May MP
Delivered on: 
15 October 2018
With permission Mr Speaker, I would like to update the House ahead of this week’s European Council.
We are entering the final stages of these negotiations.
This is the time for cool, calm heads to prevail.
And it is the time for a clear-eyed focus on the few remaining but critical issues that are still to be agreed.
Yesterday the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union went to Brussels for further talks with Michel Barnier.
There has inevitably been a great deal of inaccurate speculation.
So, I want to set out clearly for the House, the facts as they stand.
First, we have made real progress in recent weeks on both the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration on our future relationship.
And I want to pay tribute to both negotiating teams for the many, many hours of hard work that have got us to this point.
In March, we agreed legal text around the implementation period, citizens’ rights and the financial settlement.
And we have now made good progress on text concerning the majority of the outstanding issues.
Taken together, the shape of a deal across the vast majority of the withdrawal agreement - the terms of our exit - are now clear.
We also have broad agreement on the structure and scope of the framework for our future relationship, with progress on issues like security, transport and services.
And perhaps, most significantly, we have made progress on Northern Ireland – where, Mr Speaker, the EU have been working with us to respond to the very real concerns we had on their original proposals.
Mr Speaker, let me remind the House why this is so important.
Both the UK and the EU share a profound responsibility to ensure the preservation of the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, protecting the hard won peace and stability in Northern Ireland and ensuring that life continues essentially as it does now.
We agree that our future economic partnership should provide for solutions to the unique circumstances in Northern Ireland in the long term.
And, while we are both committed to ensuring that this future relationship is in place by the end of the implementation period, we accept that there is a chance that there may be a gap between the two.
This is what creates the need for a backstop to ensure that, if such a temporary gap were ever to arise, there would be no hard-border between Northern Ireland and Ireland – or indeed anything that would threaten the integrity of our precious union.
So this backstop is intended to be an insurance policy for people of Northern Ireland and Ireland.
Previously, the European Union had proposed a backstop that would see Northern Ireland carved-off in the EU’s customs union and parts of the single market, separated through a border in the Irish Sea from the UK’s own internal market.
As I have said many times, I could never accept that, no matter how unlikely such a scenario may be.
Creating any form of customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK would mean a fundamental change in the day-to-day experience for businesses in Northern Ireland – with the potential to affect jobs and investment.
We published our proposals on customs in the backstop in June, and after Salzburg, I said we would bring forward our own further proposals – and that is what we have done in these negotiations.
And the European Union have responded positively by agreeing to explore a UK-wide customs solution to this backstop.
But Mr Speaker, two problems remain.
First, the EU says there is not time to work out the detail of this UK-wide solution in the next few weeks.
So even with the progress we have made, the EU still requires a “backstop to the backstop” – effectively an insurance policy for the insurance policy.
And they want this to be the Northern Ireland-only solution that they had previously proposed.
We have been clear that we cannot agree to anything that threatens the integrity of our United Kingdom.
And I am sure the whole House shares the government’s view on this.
Indeed, the House of Commons set out its view when agreeing unanimously part 6, section 55 of the Taxation (Cross-border Trade Act) on a single United Kingdom customs territory.
This states:
“It shall be unlawful for Her Majesty’s Government to enter into arrangements under which Northern Ireland forms part of a separate customs territory to Great Britain.”
So, Mr Speaker, this message is clear – not just from this government, but from this whole House.
Second, Mr Speaker, I need to be able to look the British people in the eye and say this backstop is a temporary solution.
People are rightly concerned that what is only meant to be temporary could become a permanent limbo – with no new relationship between the UK and the EU ever agreed.
I am clear we are not going to be trapped permanently in a single customs territory unable to do meaningful trade deals.
So it must be the case, first, that the backstop should not need to come into force.
Second, that if it does, it must be temporary.
And third – while I do not believe this will be the case - if the EU were not to co-operate on our future relationship, we must be able to ensure that we cannot be kept in this backstop arrangement indefinitely.
I would not expect this House to agree to a deal unless we have the reassurance that the UK, as a sovereign nation, has this say over our arrangements with the EU.
Mr Speaker, I do not believe the UK and the EU are far apart.
We both agree that Article 50 cannot provide the legal basis for a permanent relationship.
And we both agree this backstop must be temporary.
So we must now work together to give effect to that agreement.
Mr Speaker, so much of these negotiations are necessarily technical.
But the reason this all matters is because it affects the future of our country.
It affects jobs and livelihoods in every community. It is about what kind of country we are and about our faith in our democracy.
Of course, it is frustrating that almost all of the remaining points of disagreement are focused on how we manage a scenario which both sides hope should never come to pass – and which if it does, will only be temporary.
We cannot let this disagreement derail the prospects of a good deal and leave us with the no deal outcome that no-one wants.
I continue to believe that a negotiated deal is the best outcome for the UK and for the European Union.
I continue to believe that such a deal is achievable.
And that is the spirit in which I will continue to work with our European partners.
And I commend this Statement to the House.

<p>Launching at the <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.phe-events.org.uk/hpa/frontend/reg/thome.csp?pageID=265394&amp;eventID=671&amp;traceRedir=2"">International Society for Physical Activity and Health Congress (<abbr title=""International Society for Physical Activity and Health Congress"">ISPAH</abbr>)</a> this week (15 to 17 October 2018), the new digital <a rel=""external"" href=""https://movingmedicine.ac.uk/"">Moving Medicine tool</a> will help healthcare professionals advise patients on how physical activity can help to manage their conditions, prevent disease and aid recovery.</p>

<p>It is produced by the Faculty of Sport and Exercise Medicine (<abbr title=""Faculty of Sport and Exercise Medicine"">FSEM</abbr>) in partnership with Public Health England (<abbr title=""Public Health England"">PHE</abbr>) and Sport England with support from National Lottery funding.</p>

<p>Currently one in four of the population in England does less than 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity a week and are classified as inactive.</p>

<p>Physical inactivity is in the top 10 greatest causes of ill health nationally, with negative impacts on health, wellbeing, social and economic outcomes for individuals and communities.</p>

<p>Evidence shows that one in four patients would be more active if advised by a <abbr title=""general practitioner (family doctor)"">GP</abbr> or nurse, yet nearly three quarters of <abbr title=""general practitioner (family doctors)"">GPs</abbr> do not speak about the benefits of physical activity to patients due to either lack of knowledge, skills or confidence.</p>

<p>The tool focuses on helping to address the most common long term health conditions affecting the population, such as cancer, depression, musculoskeletal pain and type 2 diabetes.</p>

<p>Developed in consultation with over 300 healthcare professionals and patients and using evidence-based step-by-step guidance, Moving Medicine is designed to provide healthcare professionals with the latest evidence to address this knowledge and skills gap in the NHS and support healthier outcomes for patients as a result.</p>

<p>Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP, Secretary of State for Health and Social care said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a mountain of evidence to suggest that patients with all kinds of conditions – from depression to diabetes – would benefit from more exercise, yet understandably those suffering with chronic illness are more likely to be inactive.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">That’s why it’s so important healthcare professionals have the information they need at their fingertips to advise patients with complex health needs on how to get more active – and this doesn’t have to mean joining a gym. It can be doing more of the things we love, whether that’s playing football, swimming or going for long walks. I am delighted to launch this brilliant web tool for healthcare professionals – I hope it will help pave the way for a culture shift in medicine where referrals for exercise are just as common as prescriptions for medication.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr Alison Tedstone, Head of Physical Activity at Public Health England, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With millions accessing the NHS every day, healthcare professionals play a vital role in helping people to better understand the benefits of physical activity on their health.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">Taking the time to have these conversations has the power to inspire people to move more and make a big difference to their health.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr Paul D Jackson, President, Faculty of Sport and Exercise Medicine (UK) said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The development of the Moving Medicine platform has been a truly collaborative effort, drawing on the expertise of many across a wide range of different disciplines and professional bodies as well as medical Royal Colleges, associated charities and patient groups.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">We all believe that introducing more physical activity into every care pathway across the NHS is an essential, cost-effective intervention to improve people’s health. Moving Medicine will ensure that all health care professionals have up to date information on physical activity presented in a useable, easy to understand format, enabling them to inform their patients and motivate them to become more active.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sarah Ruane, Strategic Lead for Health, Sport England said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We know that it can be difficult to fit being active into busy lives. But for people who are dealing with illness or injury the thought of being active can be even more daunting. That’s why healthcare professionals have such a vital role to play.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">Moving Medicine is a simple idea with huge potential to transform the lives of the millions of people who are inactive and living with health conditions. Equipping healthcare professionals with the practical information that they need to have supportive conversations with their patients, will help many more people to experience the range of health benefits that being active can bring.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Moving Medicine is a major component of the Moving Healthcare Professionals Programme, which is designed to support healthcare professionals embed physical activity into their approach to treating patients for common conditions in line with existing <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng28/resources/type-2-diabetes-in-adults-management-pdf-1837338615493"">National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance</a>.</p>

<p>The resource has been launched at the seventh <abbr title=""International Society for Physical Activity and Health Congress"">ISPAH</abbr> congress in London this week (15 to 17 October 2018), which aims to bring the best minds together to bridge the gap between physical activity research, policy and practice to support healthier nations across the world.</p>

New physical activity resource for health professionals
A new resource that will improve conversations about physical activity between patients and healthcare professionals has been launched. 
Published 16 October 2018
From:
Public Health England
Launching at the International Society for Physical Activity and Health Congress (ISPAH) this week (15 to 17 October 2018), the new digital Moving Medicine tool will help healthcare professionals advise patients on how physical activity can help to manage their conditions, prevent disease and aid recovery.
It is produced by the Faculty of Sport and Exercise Medicine (FSEM) in partnership with Public Health England (PHE) and Sport England with support from National Lottery funding.
Currently one in four of the population in England does less than 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity a week and are classified as inactive.
Physical inactivity is in the top 10 greatest causes of ill health nationally, with negative impacts on health, wellbeing, social and economic outcomes for individuals and communities.
Evidence shows that one in four patients would be more active if advised by a GP or nurse, yet nearly three quarters of GPs do not speak about the benefits of physical activity to patients due to either lack of knowledge, skills or confidence.
The tool focuses on helping to address the most common long term health conditions affecting the population, such as cancer, depression, musculoskeletal pain and type 2 diabetes.
Developed in consultation with over 300 healthcare professionals and patients and using evidence-based step-by-step guidance, Moving Medicine is designed to provide healthcare professionals with the latest evidence to address this knowledge and skills gap in the NHS and support healthier outcomes for patients as a result.
Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP, Secretary of State for Health and Social care said:
There is a mountain of evidence to suggest that patients with all kinds of conditions – from depression to diabetes – would benefit from more exercise, yet understandably those suffering with chronic illness are more likely to be inactive.
That’s why it’s so important healthcare professionals have the information they need at their fingertips to advise patients with complex health needs on how to get more active – and this doesn’t have to mean joining a gym. It can be doing more of the things we love, whether that’s playing football, swimming or going for long walks. I am delighted to launch this brilliant web tool for healthcare professionals – I hope it will help pave the way for a culture shift in medicine where referrals for exercise are just as common as prescriptions for medication.
Dr Alison Tedstone, Head of Physical Activity at Public Health England, said:
With millions accessing the NHS every day, healthcare professionals play a vital role in helping people to better understand the benefits of physical activity on their health.
Taking the time to have these conversations has the power to inspire people to move more and make a big difference to their health.
Dr Paul D Jackson, President, Faculty of Sport and Exercise Medicine (UK) said:
The development of the Moving Medicine platform has been a truly collaborative effort, drawing on the expertise of many across a wide range of different disciplines and professional bodies as well as medical Royal Colleges, associated charities and patient groups.
We all believe that introducing more physical activity into every care pathway across the NHS is an essential, cost-effective intervention to improve people’s health. Moving Medicine will ensure that all health care professionals have up to date information on physical activity presented in a useable, easy to understand format, enabling them to inform their patients and motivate them to become more active.
Sarah Ruane, Strategic Lead for Health, Sport England said:
We know that it can be difficult to fit being active into busy lives. But for people who are dealing with illness or injury the thought of being active can be even more daunting. That’s why healthcare professionals have such a vital role to play.
Moving Medicine is a simple idea with huge potential to transform the lives of the millions of people who are inactive and living with health conditions. Equipping healthcare professionals with the practical information that they need to have supportive conversations with their patients, will help many more people to experience the range of health benefits that being active can bring.
Moving Medicine is a major component of the Moving Healthcare Professionals Programme, which is designed to support healthcare professionals embed physical activity into their approach to treating patients for common conditions in line with existing National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance.
The resource has been launched at the seventh ISPAH congress in London this week (15 to 17 October 2018), which aims to bring the best minds together to bridge the gap between physical activity research, policy and practice to support healthier nations across the world.

<p>The UK Council for Internet Safety (UKCIS) is the successor to the UK Council for Child Internet Safety (UKCCIS), with an expanded scope to improve online safety for everyone in the UK.</p>

<p>The Executive Board brings together expertise from a range of organisations in the tech industry, civil society and public sector.</p>

<p>Margot James, Minister for Digital and the Creative Industries said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">Only through collaborative action will the UK be the safest place to be online. By bringing together a wealth of expertise from a wide range of fields, UKCIS can be an example to the world on how we can work together to face the challenges of the digital revolution in an effective and responsible way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>UKCIS has been established to allow these organisations to collaborate and coordinate a UK-wide approach to online safety.</p>

<p>It will contribute to the Government’s commitment to make the UK the safest place in the world to be online, and will help to inform the development of the forthcoming Online Harms White Paper.</p>

<p>Priority areas of focus will include online harms experienced by children such as cyberbullying and sexual exploitation; radicalisation and extremism; violence against women and girls; hate crime and hate speech; and forms of discrimination against groups protected under the Equality Act, for example on the basis of disability or race.</p>

<p>CEO of Internet Matters Carolyn Bunting said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are delighted to sit on the Executive Board of UKCIS where we are able to represent parents needs in keeping their children safe online.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">Online safety demands a collaborative approach and by bringing industry together we hope we can bring about real change and help everyone benefit from the opportunities the digital world has to offer.</p>

Press release
Board announced for new UK Council for Internet Safety
The Government has today announced the organisations that will sit on the Executive Board of a new national body to tackle online harms in the UK.
Published 30 October 2018
From:
Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport, UK Council for Internet Safety, and Margot James MP
The UK Council for Internet Safety (UKCIS) is the successor to the UK Council for Child Internet Safety (UKCCIS), with an expanded scope to improve online safety for everyone in the UK.
The Executive Board brings together expertise from a range of organisations in the tech industry, civil society and public sector.
Margot James, Minister for Digital and the Creative Industries said:
Only through collaborative action will the UK be the safest place to be online. By bringing together a wealth of expertise from a wide range of fields, UKCIS can be an example to the world on how we can work together to face the challenges of the digital revolution in an effective and responsible way.
UKCIS has been established to allow these organisations to collaborate and coordinate a UK-wide approach to online safety.
It will contribute to the Government’s commitment to make the UK the safest place in the world to be online, and will help to inform the development of the forthcoming Online Harms White Paper.
Priority areas of focus will include online harms experienced by children such as cyberbullying and sexual exploitation; radicalisation and extremism; violence against women and girls; hate crime and hate speech; and forms of discrimination against groups protected under the Equality Act, for example on the basis of disability or race.
CEO of Internet Matters Carolyn Bunting said:
We are delighted to sit on the Executive Board of UKCIS where we are able to represent parents needs in keeping their children safe online.
Online safety demands a collaborative approach and by bringing industry together we hope we can bring about real change and help everyone benefit from the opportunities the digital world has to offer.
ENDS

<p>The UK has secured a significant change to the international aid rules which would allow high income countries, which experience economic shocks, caused by crises and natural disasters, to apply to receive ODA.</p>

<p>It comes after the UK was the driving force for change when many Caribbean islands, including some British Overseas Territories, were left devastated by two category five hurricanes in autumn 2017, Irma and Maria.</p>

<p>At the time, there was no system in place for such countries to automatically requalify for aid if their economies were badly hit in such circumstances.

<p>Once a country reaches the World Bank’s High-Income threshold for three consecutive years, under the OECD DAC rules they are not considered ODA-eligible.</p>

<p>The new ‘reverse-graduation’ mechanism means that British Overseas Territories and other Caribbean islands badly damaged by hurricanes could requalify for aid in the future if their economy is sufficiently badly affected. The rule change could benefit the UK when it assists with the economic recovery and reconstruction of nations hit by natural disasters.</p>

<p>The UK government has always been clear that in times of crisis, nothing will hold us back from helping the British territories. The ODA rules have not and will not hamper the UK’s response to humanitarian crises. The new mechanism could help protect a country’s hard-fought development gains and prevent it from slipping into long-term economic decline due to severe natural disasters in the future.</p>

UK secures change to international aid rules
Restrictions to Britain’s aid support to countries affected by crises and natural disasters that severely impact their economy are lifted 
Published 1 November 2018
From:
Department for International Development and The Rt Hon Penny Mordaunt MP
The UK has secured a significant change to the international aid rules which would allow high income countries, which experience economic shocks, caused by crises and natural disasters, to apply to receive ODA.
It comes after the UK was the driving force for change when many Caribbean islands, including some British Overseas Territories, were left devastated by two category five hurricanes in autumn 2017, Irma and Maria.
At the time, there was no system in place for such countries to automatically requalify for aid if their economies were badly hit in such circumstances.  Countries would only requalify for aid if their economies were so badly hit, their economies dipped under the World Bank High Income threshold.
Because of the UK’s campaign for change, the Development Assistance Committee (DAC), which is made up of 30 leading donor nations, has agreed a new ‘reverse-graduation’ mechanism.
This means countries that have graduated from being eligible for aid will now be able to receive assistance if their economies worsen and fall below the World Bank threshold.
Such countries would be eligible for aid related to long-term economic recovery and reconstruction, rather than humanitarian assistance.

<p>Work to bring civil, family and tribunal hearings into one accessible building in Newcastle city centre have taken a step forward with the signing of a new lease.</p>

<p>The development will provide a modern, fit for purpose building for local people, legal professionals, judiciary, and courts and tribunals staff. The new courthouse is expected to open by 2020.</p>

<p>We have been working in partnership with Newcastle City Council to develop plans and designs for the Civic Centre, which is being fully refurbished and will include the new Civil, Family and Tribunals (CFT) courthouse.</p>

<p>Linda Ventress, HMCTS regional estates strategy lead, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">This new court will help provide a modern, fit for purpose building for the people of Newcastle. We are delighted to see the next stage of the project begin and look forward to bringing civil, family and tribunal work into one location, making it easier and more efficient for people to access justice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the first part of a wider plan for the courts in Newcastle, which will also see conversion of the existing Newcastle Combined Court into a Criminal Justice Centre.</p>

<p>The government is investing £1bn in reforming courts and tribunals, including making significant improvements to the condition and design of court buildings. This will improve the experience of visiting or working in a court, and lead to better value for taxpayers by reducing operating costs and increasing the efficiency of the estate.</p>

HMCTS sign lease for the Civic Centre with Newcastle City Council
A new civil, family and tribunals courthouse will open within Newcastle Civic Centre.
Published 5 November 2018
From:
HM Courts & Tribunals Service
Work to bring civil, family and tribunal hearings into one accessible building in Newcastle city centre have taken a step forward with the signing of a new lease.
The development will provide a modern, fit for purpose building for local people, legal professionals, judiciary, and courts and tribunals staff. The new courthouse is expected to open by 2020.
We have been working in partnership with Newcastle City Council to develop plans and designs for the Civic Centre, which is being fully refurbished and will include the new Civil, Family and Tribunals (CFT) courthouse.
Linda Ventress, HMCTS regional estates strategy lead, said:
This new court will help provide a modern, fit for purpose building for the people of Newcastle. We are delighted to see the next stage of the project begin and look forward to bringing civil, family and tribunal work into one location, making it easier and more efficient for people to access justice.
This is the first part of a wider plan for the courts in Newcastle, which will also see conversion of the existing Newcastle Combined Court into a Criminal Justice Centre.
The government is investing £1bn in reforming courts and tribunals, including making significant improvements to the condition and design of court buildings. This will improve the experience of visiting or working in a court, and lead to better value for taxpayers by reducing operating costs and increasing the efficiency of the estate.

<ul>
<li>rape support centres to benefit from greater financial security and stability</li>
  <li>five Police and Crime Commissioners to be given full control of devolved funding</li>
  <li>funding for victim support services has doubled since 2012/13 to £96 million</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Specialist rape and sexual abuse support services will receive a £800,000 (10%) boost to help more victims across England and Wales under government plans announced today (Wednesday 7 November 2018).</p>

<p>Over 150,000 sexual offences were recorded by police last year with 1 in 5 women having experienced some type of sexual assault in their lifetime and a 200 per cent increase in the number of men and boys accessing support*.</p>

<p>The additional funding –  now totalling £24 million over the next 3 years –  will go towards vital services providing advice, support and counselling to help victims cope with and, as far as possible, recover from these devastating crimes. It will also increase the resilience of the wider sector supporting vulnerable individuals to provide timely, wrap-around support.</p>

<p>In addition, dedicated support organisations will now benefit from longer-term funding with government extending the funding period from 1 to 3 years. Ministers have acted to provide support organisations with greater stability and security to ensure they can focus on delivering their essential services.</p>

<p>Justice Minister Edward Argar said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rape and sexual violence are devastating crimes, so I am encouraged that more victims are coming forward to get the support they need.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">By providing additional and longer-term funding we are ensuring that victims can access these vital practical and emotional services, so that fewer are left to suffer in silence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today’s announcement builds on the government’s commitment to further devolve justice powers. Five Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs) (Greater London, Cambridgeshire, Essex, Hampshire and Nottinghamshire) are to be given full commissioning responsibilities for sexual violence and abuse services as government recognises the importance of identifying local need when providing support.</p>

<p>In 2018/19 the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) allocated around £7.2 million towards independent, specialist support to female and male victims of sexual violence, including victims of child sexual abuse. This will now increase to £8 million annually over the next three years and is part of £96 million funding towards victim support services which has doubled since 2012/13.</p>

<p>Faye Maxted OBE, Chief executive of the Survivors Trust, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">The announcement of this funding is very welcome and the fact that it will be awarded for a three-year period will allow specialist agencies to plan ahead and feel some security in offering support for victims and survivors.  Rape and sexual abuse can have a devastating impact on someone’s life, affecting their health and wellbeing for years and impacting on their ability to live a fulfilling and happy life.  Security and safety are such vital elements in recovery for victims and survivors and this means that specialist support agencies themselves need to be sure the services they offer are well supported too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Duncan Craig, CEO of Survivors Manchester &amp; Co-Founder of Male Survivors Partnership, and survivors of childhood sexual abuse:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">The government’s announcement of the investment it’s making in tackling rape and sexual abuse is more than welcome. Increasing the amount of money available for organisations to access and extending the grants to three years gives a clear message that the Minister is taking our needs as survivors seriously. Organisations like mine, those members of networks such as Male Survivors Partnership or Rape Crisis England and Wales are struggling to meet the increasing demand on our services from people who often, are speaking out for the first time. This announcement feels like help is on its way and gives me hope that we will be able to not only continue to provide the support services to men and women, boys and girls who have been sexually violated, but in doing so give people hope that healing is possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Katie Russell at Rape Crisis England &amp; Wales said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Demand for independent, specialist sexual violence and abuse support services is at unprecedented levels and continues to rise each year.</p>

  <p>In 2017-18, our member Rape Crisis Centres provided over 650,000 sessions of specialist support, counselling and advocacy to more than 78,000 victims and survivors of child sexual abuse, rape and all forms of sexual violence.</p>

  <p>This is the only dedicated, central government funding for sexual violence and abuse organisations and recognises the significant need for these vital services, and the considerable expertise and experience of our specialist sector.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">Three-year core grants also provide some much-needed stability for centres like ours, enabling them to focus more energy on service delivery and further development, and less on survival.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>APCC Victims Lead, Dame Vera Baird QC said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">I welcome the 10% increase, and it is particularly positive that funding for rape support will now be for a three-year period. Longer-term funding will provide these vital organisations with the stability they require, and free them from the burden of making fresh bids every year, so they can devote their time and resources on better serving victims.</p>

Government increases funding for rape and sexual abuse victims
Funding increased by 10% to £24 million over 3 years.

      <div class=""govspeak"">
<p>The Environment Agency project was aimed to help fish and eels navigate safely over the weir structure on the River Colne while ensuring that the flood risk and water resources data collected by the Earls Colne gauging station was unaffected.</p>

<p>However given the unusual shape of the gauging weir, it was a complicated fish pass to design, with the added issue of having to dry a section of the river out for the work to be completed.</p>

<p>Despite a setback during the construction, where some vital tools and a JCB was stolen, the design was still successfully completed in just four weeks.</p>

<p>Contractors carried out the work, which involved fixing low cost baffles (a structure to redirect the flow of water) and eel tiles to the weir. However to ensure this was done accurately and safely, the work area had to be dried out for the duration of the work.</p>

<p>A dam was constructed upstream and downstream and large pumps were used to bypass the structure.
As the water levels were slowly lowered while the work area was being dried out, the contractor safely relocated the fish and eels that remained by the weir.</p>

<p>An Environment Agency spokesperson said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two eels were found downstream of the structure while the contractors were drying out the work area. This is really encouraging as it demonstrates that they can get as far as Earls Colne. The new eel pass should now help them further up the catchment.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">We are excited to have completed the project and we are looking forward to the next step where we will be monitoring the flow data and surveying the fish populations to see if it can be rolled out elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This weir is one of 22 Essex Profile weirs, which means it has a particularly unusual shape. The fish pass was specifically designed to fit this shape and if it proves to be successful, it can be replicated on other structures. 
Man-made structures can obstruct fish from moving freely around the river system. If fish cannot reach their spawning or feeding habitat, then they cannot build their populations and numbers decline. Where it is not possible to remove an obstruction, a fish pass is a favourable option.</p>

<p>The European eel is a well-known example of a declining species. Numbers have fallen 95% over the last 30 years and by adding eel tiles to the fish pass, this will help this protected species to continue its fascinating life cycle.</p>

Press release
Helping fish and eels along their journey
A specially designed fish pass could be rolled out across Essex to allow fish to travel more easily through rivers.
Published 15 November 2018
From:
Environment Agency
The weir structure on the River Colne
The Environment Agency project was aimed to help fish and eels navigate safely over the weir structure on the River Colne while ensuring that the flood risk and water resources data collected by the Earls Colne gauging station was unaffected.
However given the unusual shape of the gauging weir, it was a complicated fish pass to design, with the added issue of having to dry a section of the river out for the work to be completed.
Despite a setback during the construction, where some vital tools and a JCB was stolen, the design was still successfully completed in just four weeks.
Contractors carried out the work, which involved fixing low cost baffles (a structure to redirect the flow of water) and eel tiles to the weir. However to ensure this was done accurately and safely, the work area had to be dried out for the duration of the work.
A dam was constructed upstream and downstream and large pumps were used to bypass the structure.
As the water levels were slowly lowered while the work area was being dried out, the contractor safely relocated the fish and eels that remained by the weir.
An Environment Agency spokesperson said:
Two eels were found downstream of the structure while the contractors were drying out the work area. This is really encouraging as it demonstrates that they can get as far as Earls Colne. The new eel pass should now help them further up the catchment.
We are excited to have completed the project and we are looking forward to the next step where we will be monitoring the flow data and surveying the fish populations to see if it can be rolled out elsewhere.
This weir is one of 22 Essex Profile weirs, which means it has a particularly unusual shape. The fish pass was specifically designed to fit this shape and if it proves to be successful, it can be replicated on other structures. 
Man-made structures can obstruct fish from moving freely around the river system. If fish cannot reach their spawning or feeding habitat, then they cannot build their populations and numbers decline. Where it is not possible to remove an obstruction, a fish pass is a favourable option.
The European eel is a well-known example of a declining species. Numbers have fallen 95% over the last 30 years and by adding eel tiles to the fish pass, this will help this protected species to continue its fascinating life cycle.

<p>The signing of the Armed Forces (Gibraltar) Act marks an important milestone for both the UK and Gibraltar and will ensure the relationship between Service Police on The Rock and the Royal Gibraltar Police to go from strength to strength.</p>

<p>Armed Forces Minister Mark Lancaster said:</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">Gibraltar is of vital importance to the UK Armed Forces and our allies.  Whilst our relationship with the EU is changing, our commitment to European prosperity and security remains steadfast and our duty to support Gibraltar, its people and its economy is resolute.</p>

<p>Mark Lancaster also met Chief Minister Fabian Picardo, they discussed the strategic importance of Gibraltar to UK defence. Its value is best demonstrated by the support delivered to HMS Ocean as she docked to load humanitarian aid and disaster relief before sailing to the Caribbean Islands to assist those devastated by Hurricane Irma in 2017 as well as welcoming future flagship, HMS Queen Elizabeth, this year whilst on sea trials.</p>

<p>While onboard HMS Diamond, Mark Lancaster also met Commanding Officer, Commander Ben Keith, and his crew who are returning from training in the eastern Mediterranean. The Portsmouth-based Type 45 warship and her 200 crew have been tested by fighter jets including Tornados, Typhoons and F16s, plus E3 surveillance aircraft and Voyager transporters in the skies above and around Cyprus as well as training in anti-submarine warfare.</p>

<p>The Minister also took the opportunity to catch up with a number of units within British Forces Gibraltar.  A visit to the Spyglass and Rockgun Battery’s was followed by a visit to the Gibraltar Defence Police Headquarters.  He then met with UK Armed Forces service personnel stationed at RAF Gibraltar and got the chance to see the Airfield Fire and Rescue Service’s new fire vehicles, which have been procured through joint funding between MOD and HMGoG.</p>

<p>Addressing delegates at the Association of Colleges (<abbr title=""Association of Colleges"">AoC</abbr>) annual conference in Birmingham, Ofsted’s Chief Inspector will say that many of the 170,000 young people doing level 2 study programmes are facing narrow options and limited flexibility.</p>

<p>Ms Spielman’s comments come as Ofsted publishes a <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/level-2-study-programmes"">major report on the curriculum</a> available to students taking level 2 study programmes at further education colleges. Often these young people do not have 5 good GCSEs and there are gaps in their understanding of English and maths.</p>

<div class=""call-to-action"">
<p>Read the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/level-2-study-programmes"">Level 2 study programmes</a> report.</p>
</div>

<p>The report says that these young people’s life-long employability depends on the ability of teachers to redirect their education into a course that stimulates and motivates them, and which offers the prospect of further study, training or work. However, it finds that for too long they have been seen by policy makers as “other people’s children” and, as a result, their needs have not always been met.</p>

<p>In her speech to the <abbr title=""Association of Colleges"">AoC</abbr>, HM Chief Inspector Amanda Spielman will say the report found that the colleges that were thinking most deeply about curriculum did 3 important things:</p>

<ul>
<li>collaborate with local employers to design and deliver curricula that set up learners for good local jobs</li>
  <li>recognise the importance of personal, social and employability skills</li>
  <li>evaluate the benefits of their study programmes by properly tracking destinations and feed that back into curriculum design</li>
</ul>
<p>Today’s report also outlines concern about the number of courses on offer that do not lead to good local jobs. Ofsted found that many colleges collected little data about learners’ destinations. But those colleges that did were able to give Ofsted a view about which courses had the best and worst employment prospects.</p>

<p>Art and media courses were seen by students as having the least chance of leading to a job, but at least 3  colleges surveyed by Ofsted reported these courses as having the most applicants.</p>

<p>Ms Spielman will say in her speech:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Arts and media does stand out as the area where there is greatest mismatch between the numbers of students taking the courses and their future employment in the industry. There is a point up to which courses that engage learners have value but ultimately there have to be viable prospects at the end.</p>

  <p>Yet even with the poor prospects, course adverts often listed potential jobs in the arts which are, in reality, unlikely to be available to the vast majority of learners but underplay the value of other skills these courses develop.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">These colleges risk giving false hope to students. It raises the question: are they putting the financial imperative of headcount in the classroom ahead of the best interests of the young people taking up their courses. If so, this isn’t acceptable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ofsted has already announced that there will be a stronger emphasis on the curriculum in the new Education Inspection Framework, which will take effect in September 2019. There will also be a new judgement for ‘quality of education’. This will replace the current ‘outcomes for pupils’ and ‘teaching, learning and assessment’ judgements with a broader, single judgement. The Chief Inspector will use her speech to the Association of Colleges to outline how these plans will relate to the further education and skills sector.</p>

<p>Ms Spielman will continue:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Inspectors will still judge the progress that learners are making from their starting points, but will evaluate this in terms of how they have developed new knowledge, skills and behaviours rather than the amount of progress they have made towards achieving a component of a qualification.</p>

  <p>In the new framework inspectors will want to make sure that learners are developing a deep understanding of the subject and that this is embedded in their long term memory. Inspectors will want to see that learners are able to recall information and have the skills to complete tasks routinely, rather than simply for a one-off assessment or test.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">We want to send a clear message that teaching to the test to achieve high achievement rates is not good practice, and there is no need to continually assess learners to predict likely achievement grades. That time is far better spent making sure learners accumulate all the required knowledge, skills and behaviours.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a result, today’s report recommends that colleges should:</p>

<ul>
<li>engage actively with employers, who should co-design and implement aspects of the curriculum and assess learners</li>
  <li>review their current minimum requirements for level 2 and level 3 study programmes to make sure that they are appropriate</li>
  <li>ensure that teachers are up to date with the practices and jobs available in their industry</li>
  <li>arrange work experience so that they are relevant to learners’ programmes of study</li>
  <li>give clearer feedback to learners on their progress</li>
  <li>not focus too much on qualification outcomes</li>
  <li>evaluate whether level 2 learners improve their progression into careers by progressing to a level 3 study programme</li>
</ul>
<p>Ofsted also recommends that the Department for Education should provide guidance to colleges about the information they should publish on their websites about student destinations, and evaluate the impact of the policy requiring students to re-sit their English and mathematics GCSE.</p>

Press release
College students with unrealised potential deserve better
Colleges must work more effectively with local employers to help unlock the unrealised potential of young people taking level 2 study programmes, Amanda Spielman will say in a speech this afternoon.  
Published 21 November 2018
From:
Ofsted
Addressing delegates at the Association of Colleges (AoC) annual conference in Birmingham, Ofsted’s Chief Inspector will say that many of the 170,000 young people doing level 2 study programmes are facing narrow options and limited flexibility.
Ms Spielman’s comments come as Ofsted publishes a major report on the curriculum available to students taking level 2 study programmes at further education colleges. Often these young people do not have 5 good GCSEs and there are gaps in their understanding of English and maths.
Read the Level 2 study programmes report.
The report says that these young people’s life-long employability depends on the ability of teachers to redirect their education into a course that stimulates and motivates them, and which offers the prospect of further study, training or work. However, it finds that for too long they have been seen by policy makers as “other people’s children” and, as a result, their needs have not always been met.

Today’s report also outlines concern about the number of courses on offer that do not lead to good local jobs. Ofsted found that many colleges collected little data about learners’ destinations. But those colleges that did were able to give Ofsted a view about which courses had the best and worst employment prospects.
Art and media courses were seen by students as having the least chance of leading to a job, but at least 3  colleges surveyed by Ofsted reported these courses as having the most applicants.

Ofsted also recommends that the Department for Education should provide guidance to colleges about the information they should publish on their websites about student destinations, and evaluate the impact of the policy requiring students to re-sit their English and mathematics GCSE.

Quantum leap: prototype devices will be ready in 2 years’ time
From underground sensors to safer communications, quantum pioneer funding will develop cutting-edge prototypes in 2 years’ time.

Artist's imagining of a quantum computer processor.
Advancements in quantum technologies are predicted to have a big impact on our lives – from creating navigation systems that can operate without GPS to new cameras that can see around corners.
To help accelerate progress in this field, the government is funding 4 projects that will use the latest quantum technology to develop prototype devices. Projects will receive a share of £20 million from the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund, delivered by UK Research and Innovation.
What is quantum technology? Read the blog from Challenge Director, Roger McKinlay.
It follows the Chancellor’s announcement of up to £235 million of further support to develop the next generation of transformative quantum technologies in the Budget 2018.
This includes a new national quantum computing centre, additional investment in the next wave of the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund, and a training and skills package.
Find out more about the quantum technologies challenge.
Leading the development of quantum technologies
Projects will receive funding to develop quantum prototypes in 4 fields.
Surveying underground before you start digging
RSK will lead a project with a consortium of businesses and universities to use quantum sensors to detect objects underground. Initially, the technology will be used by road-working companies, but it could also be used in the rail network.
Precise timing
Manufacturer Teledyne e2V (UK) will lead a project to develop a pre-production prototype of a miniature atomic clock.
It will enable services such as energy supply, transport and mobile communications to function in the event of disruption to the current standard timing service, Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS).
Secure encryption
Toshiba Research Europe will lead a project to develop the UK supply of low-cost integrated chips, which will enable more secure transmission of data using new encryption technologies.
Keeping data safe
Another encryption project will be led by ArQit. It will create advanced receivers to pick up quantum key signals. These keys are used to keep data safe by using quantum technology to let companies know if the data they are transmitting has been accessed.
Making the impossible possible
Business Secretary Greg Clark said:
There is a huge future for cutting-edge science in the UK, which is why we are investing in ambitious technologies like quantum in our modern Industrial Strategy.
The projects announced today will benefit ordinary people around the country, from easing traffic congestion to offering more data security for online transactions.

Support
Further information on BPS 2018, including scheme rules and details of how payments are calculated is available here.
Stopping fraudulent activity
Claimants are also urged to remain vigilant against fraud. They should remember:
Your bank, police or the RPA will never ask you to reveal your online password, PIN or bank account details or ask you to make a payment over the telephone.
Never disclose personal information to someone you don’t know or open unknown or unexpected computer links or emails.
If in doubt, call the organisation back, ideally on a different telephone, using a number you are familiar with or you know to be official. You can find this on the organisation’s website, correspondence or statement.
Contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 without delay for advice and to register your concern

<p>A 44-year old man from Leicester has been found guilty of fishing without a licence, failing to state his name and address, and obstructing a constable in the execution of his duties in June 2018.</p>

<p>The case was brought to Leicester Magistrates Court by the Environment Agency on 5 December 2018 where Matt Ralton, of St Stephens Road, Leicester was proved guilty in his absence and ordered to pay a total penalty of £1,428.</p>

<p>The penalty includes fines of £800 plus costs of £548 and a victim surcharge of £80 after Ralton was found in breach of the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act (1975) and the Police Act (1996) on 2 June 2018 at Watery Gate, Normanton Turville, Thurlaston.</p>

<p>Following the verdict, Peter Haslock, Area Enforcement Team Leader for the Environment Agency said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This case shows anglers how seriously the courts take these offences and highlights how we do not tolerate obstructive behaviour towards our officers under any circumstances. It acts as a reminder to anglers of the importance of having a rod licence and we hope it will provide a deterrent to any angler who is thinking of fishing without a licence or of failing to give details to an officer.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">All of the money raised from rod licence sales is used to protect and improve fish stocks and fisheries, benefitting anglers and, for those caught cheating the system, we will always prosecute.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every year across the country, thousands of anglers are prosecuted for not having a fishing licence. As well as cheating other anglers, fishing illegally can carry a hefty penalty. Getting caught without a licence could land a fine of up to £2,500.</p>

<p>Any angler aged 13 or over, fishing on a river, canal or still water needs a licence. A 1-day licence costs from just £6 and an annual licence costs from just £30 (concessions available).   Licences are available from <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/fishing-licences/buy-a-fishing-licence"">www.gov.uk/get-a-fishing-licence</a> or by calling the Environment Agency on 0344 800 5386 between 8am and 6pm, Monday to Friday.</p>

<p>Anyone with information about illegal fishing activities can contact the Environment Agency Incident Hotline on 0800 80 70 60 or anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>

Fishing trip cost Leicester man over £1,400 – a licence costs £30

<p>I’m delighted to be joining Mrs Pribilović, Montenegrin Minister of Public Administration, to open this first in a series of three National Awareness Raising Round Tables on cyber security, this one looking at the growing threat of state-sponsored attacks in cyberspace, in order to facilitate a discussion on how best to identify and respond to these attacks, and to explore models for establishing national cyber-resilience and comprehensive cyber defences.</p>

<p>As our digitally connected world expands at an extraordinary rate, so to does the scale of vulnerabilities and the frequency of attacks that we face. Thousands of public and private sector organisations worldwide are falling victim to ransomware attacks. Global supply chains are being compromised. Critical national infrastructure continues to be a target for attack from nation states and cyber criminals. And we are seeing threats to our democracies from attempted outside interference.</p>

<p>As the British Home Secretary told an international conference in April, over the last year we’ve seen a significant increase in the scale and severity of malicious cyber activity globally.  We know there are several established, capable states seeking to exploit computer and communications networks in contravention of their obligations under international law.</p>

<figure class=""image embedded""><div class=""img""><img src=""https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/82368/GetImage.aspx.jpeg"" alt=""National Awareness Raising Round Table in Podgorica, Copyright: Government of Montenegro""></div>
<figcaption>National Awareness Raising Round Table in Podgorica, Copyright: Government of Montenegro</figcaption></figure><p>The UK, Montenegro and other allies are concerned about the scale and complexity of cyber attacks from hostile states, groups and individuals who use cyber tools to commit crimes, to project power, to intimidate their adversaries, and to influence and manipulate societies in a manner that makes definitive attribution difficult.</p>

<p>The UK National Cyber Security Centre has reported that it is currently repelling around 10 attempted cyber attacks every week and ‘hostile states’ are said to be responsible for the bulk of these.  The UK believes that the majority of these attacks are perpetrated from within nation states in some way hostile to us.  They are undertaken by groups of computer hackers directed, sponsored or tolerated by the governments of those countries.” </p>

<p>And so we have started to work with partners to call out this activity.  You will have seen the UK’s recent attribution of a range of malicious cyber attacks to the work of the Russian Military Intelligence.  This builds upon a host of cyber attacks we attributed with our international partners - including the WannaCry incident, one of the most substantial to hit the UK in terms of scale and disruption, to North Korean actors.</p>

<p>These are difficult and sensitive subjects.  There is no perfect solution, as the way we use the internet – both for benign and malign purposes continues to evolve - so states’ responses and the steps we take to build resilience must also evolve.</p>

<p>The perpetrators of cyber attacks are difficult to identify because states do not attack directly, but through proxies; because of the growing use by states of cyber capabilities together with other techniques to achieve so-called hybrid attacks; and, the cumulative, destabilising effect of persistent, lower impact, state-sponsored cyber-attacks on a victim state or states.</p>

<p>The only effective way to face these shared threats is jointly: which is why the UK stands strong with its international partners and allies, and is working alongside them to confront, expose, and disrupt hostile or malicious activity.  In the UK, we have learnt that our ability to provide successful cyber security relies on the strength of the partnerships we create: partnerships across government and agencies, and also between the public and private sectors, involving academia and civil society as appropriate.</p>

<p>So, the UK will continue to reaffirm our shared vision for an open, peaceful and secure digital world based on the rule of law and norms of behaviour.</p>

<p>Cyber security is a priority in the UK-Montenegrin bilateral relationship because it affects the security and prosperity of both our countries.  It is something that President Đukanović discussed with the British government when he visited London last week. This  Round Table couldn’t be more timely. I wish you fruitful and productive discussions and I look forward to building on your conclusions going forward.</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

This builds upon a host of cyber attacks we attributed with our international partners - including the WannaCry incident, one of the most substantial to hit the UK in terms of scale and disruption, to North Korean actors.
These are difficult and sensitive subjects.  There is no perfect solution, as the way we use the internet – both for benign and malign purposes continues to evolve - so states’ responses and the steps we take to build resilience must also evolve.
The perpetrators of cyber attacks are difficult to identify because states do not attack directly, but through proxies; because of the growing use by states of cyber capabilities together with other techniques to achieve so-called hybrid attacks; and, the cumulative, destabilising effect of persistent, lower impact, state-sponsored cyber-attacks on a victim state or states.
The only effective way to face these shared threats is jointly: which is why the UK stands strong with its international partners and allies, and is working alongside them to confront, expose, and disrupt hostile or malicious activity.  In the UK, we have learnt that our ability to provide successful cyber security relies on the strength of the partnerships we create: partnerships across government and agencies, and also between the public and private sectors, involving academia and civil society as appropriate.
So, the UK will continue to reaffirm our shared vision for an open, peaceful and secure digital world based on the rule of law and norms of behaviour.
Cyber security is a priority in the UK-Montenegrin bilateral relationship because it affects the security and prosperity of both our countries.  It is something that President Đukanović discussed with the British government when he visited London last week. This  Round Table couldn’t be more timely. I wish you fruitful and productive discussions and I look forward to building on your conclusions going forward.
Thank you

<p>New statistics released last week reveal that British businesses are already benefiting from the ability to trade freely with Canada without paying any duties at Canadian customs.</p>

<p>UK exports of goods to Canada have increased by 13.7% to £6.15 billion in the last 12 months since a new free trade agreement was introduced.</p>

<p>The growth in exports coincides with the provisional implementation of the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (<abbr title=""EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement"">CETA</abbr>) in September 2017.</p>

<p>It is a significant increase when compared to the 5 years prior to the agreement being introduced, which saw annual trade increase by an average of just 3.9%.</p>

<p><abbr title=""EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement"">CETA</abbr> is one of the most extensive EU free trade agreements to date and removes 98% of export duties that are currently in place.</p>

<p>The food and drink industry was previously subject to tariffs of up to 11% but these have now been reduced to zero in most cases.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, auto tariffs are being reduced from 6.1% down to zero over several years so the British motor industry is expected to benefit even more in the years ahead.</p>

<p>Meat exports to Canada increased by 36.3% last year to £2.8m and wine exports grew by 16.6% to £1.75 million.</p>

<p>A significant proportion of UK exports pass through Liverpool Port, which account for 77% meat exports and 47% of wine exports. The city is a major gateway to Canada thanks to its strategic location and its importance is expected to grow even further as a result to a £400 million expansion project.</p>

<h4 id=""international-trade-secretary-dr-liam-fox-said"">International Trade Secretary Dr Liam Fox said:</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">The rapid growth in UK exports to Canada is great news for British people, who are already seeing how our free trade agenda can help to create jobs, boost economic growth and provide more choice for consumers.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child""><abbr title=""EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement"">CETA</abbr> is one of the most ambitious free trade agreements and it will eliminate almost every tariff on goods between our two nations, giving a boost to a range of British businesses from our motor industry to our brewers and distillers.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">We are committed to transitioning this deal into UK law after we leave the EU and the Department for International Trade is on hand to help even more British businesses establish a strong foothold in the Canadian market.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><abbr title=""EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement"">CETA</abbr> was formally ratified by the UK last month and has the potential to boost UK GDP by hundreds of millions of pounds in the long-run and create jobs for British and Canadian workers. It has so far been ratified by 12 countries and it will come fully into force once all EU members have ratified it.</p>

<p>The UK and Canadian Prime Ministers have both committed to seeking to seamlessly transition <abbr title=""EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement"">CETA</abbr> into a bilateral deal that will allow UK and Canadian companies to enjoy as free and frictionless trade as possible after the UK leaves the European Union.</p>

Press release
UK trade with Canada up 14% since new free trade agreement introduced
New statistics released last week reveal that British businesses are benefiting from the increased ability to trade freely with Canada.
Published 10 December 2018
From:
Department for International Trade and The Rt Hon Liam Fox MP
CETA is one of the most extensive EU free trade agreements to date and removes 98% of export duties that are currently in place.
New statistics released last week reveal that British businesses are already benefiting from the ability to trade freely with Canada without paying any duties at Canadian customs.
UK exports of goods to Canada have increased by 13.7% to £6.15 billion in the last 12 months since a new free trade agreement was introduced.
The growth in exports coincides with the provisional implementation of the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) in September 2017.

Meanwhile, auto tariffs are being reduced from 6.1% down to zero over several years so the British motor industry is expected to benefit even more in the years ahead.
Meat exports to Canada increased by 36.3% last year to £2.8m and wine exports grew by 16.6% to £1.75 million.

<h2 id=""background"">Background</h2>

<p>The Government Chemist has a long standing interest in food allergy stemming from acknowledged difficulties in allergen analysis. Our interest focuses in three areas:</p>

<ol>
<li>
    <p>Metrologically traceable food allergen analysis (the science of ensuring allergen measurements correspond from one lab to another across the globe)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Resolution of analytical disputes about allergen measurement (referee cases)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Food allergen management – better to understand industry best practice so as to interpret allergen measurement results in the right context and offer advice to businesses, regulators, enforcement authorities and consumers on request.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>We continue to contribute to knowledge transfer in these areas. Some examples of our recent work include speaking engagements to key audiences.</p>

<p>On 3rd December 2018 Michael took part in a seminar ‘Food Allergy – human, clinical, analytical and forensic implications’ at the Institute of Global Food Security (IGFS), Queen’s University, Belfast. Organised by Dr Katrina Campbell of IGFS, this seminar mainly for MSc students in food safety brought together a spectrum of speakers.</p>

<p>Dr Hazel Gowland spoke on ‘Food Allergy: human impact and forensic implications’, Professor Clare Mills, University of Manchester described ‘Food Allergen Analysis in a Risk Assessment Context’ and Pauline Titchener, Neogen Europe Ltd, described ‘Commercial allergen diagnostics’. Michael’s talk: ‘Complementary analysis for food allergens – the <a rel=""external"" href=""https://draft-origin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/news/cumin-analysis-dna-test-for-mahaleb-developed"">almond/mahaleb story</a>’ described the resolution of several complex food recalls involving compromise of allergen test results by cross reactivity within the Prunus genus .</p>

<h3 id=""food-labelling-seminar-at-campden-bri"">Food labelling seminar at Campden BRI</h3>

<p>On 4 December 2018 Michael gave a talk: ‘Allergen labelling and regulation: Implications of UK Exit (and other things)’ at a Food Labelling Update Seminar at Campden BRI.</p>

<p>The ‘other things’ included remarks on the recent inquest on the death of a teenager after eating a baguette that was ‘prepacked for direct sale’, a form of labelling that legally permits food allergen information to be available orally on request rather than printed on the food label. The seminar, attended by over 70 food company representatives, was an opportunity to describe the Government Chemist approach to food allergy and engage in dialogue.</p>

<h3 id=""improving-metrological-traceability"">Improving metrological traceability</h3>

<p>Improvement in food allergen analysis in Official Control laboratories across the EU is being fostered by a cooperative analytical exercise called a ‘ring trial’ where labs analyse a matrix spiked with allergen and return their results for evaluation along with information on the methods they have used. Organised by the Joint Research Centre, JRC, the European Commission’s science and knowledge service, this ring trial will enable JRC to disseminate best practice advice to official labs. The Government Chemist is representing the UK in this exercise with analysis spearheaded by Malvinder Singh.</p>

Dr Hazel Gowland spoke on ‘Food Allergy: human impact and forensic implications’, Professor Clare Mills, University of Manchester described ‘Food Allergen Analysis in a Risk Assessment Context’ and Pauline Titchener, Neogen Europe Ltd, described ‘Commercial allergen diagnostics’. Michael’s talk: ‘Complementary analysis for food allergens – the almond/mahaleb story’ described the resolution of several complex food recalls involving compromise of allergen test results by cross reactivity within the Prunus genus .
From left to right, Professor Chris Elliott, Dr Hazel Gowland, Professor Clare Mills, Dr Michael Walker, Professor Duncan Thorburn BurnsDuring the seminar for the first time all five authors of the influential paper on potentially flawed allergen analysis were in the same room.
Food labelling seminar at Campden BRI
On 4 December 2018 Michael gave a talk: ‘Allergen labelling and regulation: Implications of UK Exit (and other things)’ at a Food Labelling Update Seminar at Campden BRI.
The ‘other things’ included remarks on the recent inquest on the death of a teenager after eating a baguette that was ‘prepacked for direct sale’, a form of labelling that legally permits food allergen information to be available orally on request rather than printed on the food label. The seminar, attended by over 70 food company representatives, was an opportunity to describe the Government Chemist approach to food allergy and engage in dialogue.
Improving metrological traceability
Improvement in food allergen analysis in Official Control laboratories across the EU is being fostered by a cooperative analytical exercise called a ‘ring trial’ where labs analyse a matrix spiked with allergen and return their results for evaluation along with information on the methods they have used. Organised by the Joint Research Centre, JRC, the European Commission’s science and knowledge service, this ring trial will enable JRC to disseminate best practice advice to official labs. The Government Chemist is representing the UK in this exercise with analysis spearheaded by Malvinder Singh.

<p>New approaches that would allow self-employed people, around 15 per cent of the UK workforce, to save for short, medium and long-term financial goals – for example, catering for those with irregular incomes - will be tested through trials and research to be launched imminently.</p>

<p>Automatic enrolment has transformed pension saving with almost 10 million people automatically enrolled since 2012. Now the government is embracing the challenge of encouraging the self-employed to put away money for later life.</p>

<p>Guy Opperman, Minister for Pensions and Financial Inclusion, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Only around 1 in 7 (14 per cent) self-employed people were saving into a pension in 2016 to 2017. Our trials are designed to make sure that this diverse group of people gets help to plan ahead for greater financial security and the lifestyle they aspire to in later life.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">We want to see effective, long-lasting solutions that boost the future prospects of millions of hard-working self-employed people, and will work with the financial services sector, professional trade bodies, unions and others to achieve that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Features of the trials include:</p>

<ul>
<li>encouraging employees who become self-employed to keep making regular, affordable, contributions to a pension or other long-term savings product</li>
  <li>better use of financial technology to help the self-employed overcome barriers to saving</li>
  <li>making the most of communication points of contact used by self-employed people - such as online accounting systems -  to promote saving for retirement in an easily understood way</li>
</ul>
<p>A Department for Work and Pensions <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/automatic-enrolment-evaluation-report-2018"">report</a> published today confirms the continued success of automatic enrolment. New evidence shows that the rate of people stopping saving into a workplace pension for 2017 to 2018 was just 0.7 per cent, and this has not changed in the period April to June 2018 following the first increase in minimum contributions.</p>

Help for millions of self-employed to save and plan for retirement
New ways to stimulate retirement saving among Britain’s 4.8 million self-employed will be developed and tested under plans unveiled today (18 December 2018).

      <div class=""govspeak"">
<p>Highways England introduced a 60mph speed limit on an eight-mile stretch of the motorway between Holmes Chapel and Knutsford (junctions 18 to 19) last night as it works to complete a major upgrade to add extra lanes and new technology to the M6 by spring 2019.</p>

<p>The speed limit increase from 50mph to 60mph is expected to cut journey times as tens of thousands of drivers use the route on their way home for Christmas.</p>

<p>Across England, more than 200 miles of roadworks are being lifted in time for the festive getaway to help journeys flow more smoothly and to keep disruption to a minimum.</p>

<p>Highways England will also be keeping motorways closure-free for 12 days over the festive season, so drivers travelling at night on the M6 won’t be faced with diversions due to roadworks.</p>

<p>Highways England’s project manager Arun Sahni said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The M6 through Cheshire is used by around 120,000 drivers every day so we’re keen to do everything we can to minimise disruption while the major upgrade takes place to improve journeys.</p>

  <p>We’ve been able to increase the speed limit to 60mph on almost half the scheme in time for the Christmas getaway as wider lanes have now been reinstated along this part of the motorway.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">We’re also on schedule to complete the project by the spring so drivers travelling along the M6 in Cheshire will experience quicker and more reliable journeys in 2019.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Highways England expects to be able to open the first stretch of the M6 smart motorway upgrade between junctions 18 and 19 early next year, and has been able to increase the speed limit to 60mph while testing takes place of the new technology.</p>

<p>A 50mph speed limit will remain in place for safety reasons between junctions 16 and 18 due to construction work taking place along that part of the M6.</p>

<p>When the upgrade is complete, drivers will be able to use an extra lane in each direction – increasing capacity by a third. More than 250 electronic signs will also alert drivers to changes in the speed limit, lane closures and incidents ahead.</p>

<p>A total of 70 CCTV cameras will provide 100% coverage of the route and allow Highways England’s traffic officers and the emergency services to respond quickly to incidents. And 18 emergency areas will be created alongside the motorway to provide drivers with a safe place to stop if they break down.</p>

<p>A similar smart motorway scheme on a stretch of the M62 in West Yorkshire has resulted in commuters saving an average 30 minutes each week, despite an increase in the number of vehicles using the route.</p>

<p>More details on the Cheshire scheme are available on the M6 junctions 16 to 19 smart motorway <a rel=""external"" href=""https://highwaysengland.co.uk/projects/m6-junctions-16-19-smart-motorway/"">scheme web page</a>.</p>

Press release
M6 speed increase in time for Christmas getaway
Drivers travelling through the M6 roadworks in Cheshire will be able to get home quicker from today as the speed limit has been increased in time for Christmas.
Published 21 December 2018
From:
Highways England
Highways England introduced a 60mph speed limit on an eight-mile stretch of the motorway between Holmes Chapel and Knutsford (junctions 18 to 19) last night as it works to complete a major upgrade to add extra lanes and new technology to the M6 by spring 2019.
The speed limit increase from 50mph to 60mph is expected to cut journey times as tens of thousands of drivers use the route on their way home for Christmas.
Across England, more than 200 miles of roadworks are being lifted in time for the festive getaway to help journeys flow more smoothly and to keep disruption to a minimum.
Highways England will also be keeping motorways closure-free for 12 days over the festive season, so drivers travelling at night on the M6 won’t be faced with diversions due to roadworks.
Highways England’s project manager Arun Sahni said:
The M6 through Cheshire is used by around 120,000 drivers every day so we’re keen to do everything we can to minimise disruption while the major upgrade takes place to improve journeys.
We’ve been able to increase the speed limit to 60mph on almost half the scheme in time for the Christmas getaway as wider lanes have now been reinstated along this part of the motorway.
We’re also on schedule to complete the project by the spring so drivers travelling along the M6 in Cheshire will experience quicker and more reliable journeys in 2019.
Highways England expects to be able to open the first stretch of the M6 smart motorway upgrade between junctions 18 and 19 early next year, and has been able to increase the speed limit to 60mph while testing takes place of the new technology.
A 50mph speed limit will remain in place for safety reasons between junctions 16 and 18 due to construction work taking place along that part of the M6.
When the upgrade is complete, drivers will be able to use an extra lane in each direction – increasing capacity by a third. More than 250 electronic signs will also alert drivers to changes in the speed limit, lane closures and incidents ahead.
A total of 70 CCTV cameras will provide 100% coverage of the route and allow Highways England’s traffic officers and the emergency services to respond quickly to incidents. And 18 emergency areas will be created alongside the motorway to provide drivers with a safe place to stop if they break down.
A similar smart motorway scheme on a stretch of the M62 in West Yorkshire has resulted in commuters saving an average 30 minutes each week, despite an increase in the number of vehicles using the route.
More details on the Cheshire scheme are available on the M6 junctions 16 to 19 smart motorway scheme web page.

  <li>part of new approach being piloted to improve standards and security</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>A new x-ray body scanner has been installed at HMP Leeds as a project to turn around 10 of the most challenging jails gathers pace, Prisons Minister Rory Stewart announced today (Friday 4 January 2019).</p>

<p>The scanner will allow staff to search offenders on an intelligence-led basis for drugs and other contraband concealed inside their bodies. Evidence found on prisoners can be used to support disciplinary action or criminal prosecution.</p>

<p>The scanner will help to break the cycle of violence that is fuelled by drugs and other illegal items, meaning prisoners can start the process of rehabilitation. X-ray scanners at the other jails involved in the ‘10 Prisons Project’ will follow in the coming months.</p>

<p>All 10 prisons have at least 4 metal-detecting wands in place and most of the prisons have trace detection machines that can be used to identify mail that might contain psychoactive substances.</p>

<p>The project was announced in August to tackle the serious problems facing 10 of the most challenging prisons in the country. This was backed up by £10 million of funding.</p>

<p>Other measures implemented so far include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enhanced leadership and more resources. Each prison now has a number of specialist staff and teams in place, including a drugs strategy manager, additional entry searching staff, and more dog handlers.</li>
  <li>Changes in the prison environment to improve decency, providing clean and decent sanitation as well as refurbished cells and shared areas.</li>
  <li>By Christmas, the start of the roll-out of violence reduction training for staff on wings.</li>
  <li>Nine of the 10 prisons have received a ‘drug diagnostic’ visit to help them understand their drug issues and improve processes and procedures</li>
</ul>
<p>The work in these prisons will be used as a template for the wider estate and will help to inform priority areas for future investment and development. These 10 prisons are leading the way, with successful interventions being shared widely.</p>

<p>Prisons Minister Rory Stewart said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These 10 prisons are setting the way for a new approach, a new ethos and a new direction. I am pleased to see the progress being made, and I thank the governors and staff working tirelessly to improve their prisons.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">With enhanced physical security, a drive to improve decency, and more training and support for staff, the prisons are showing what a difference can be made on the wings. Ultimately, this will help to prevent further reoffending and keep the public safe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The project is part of a wider effort to restore stability to the prison estate. This year the government has announced an additional £70 million investment in safety, security and decency.</p>

<p>This included £16 million to improve conditions for prisoners and staff and £7 million on new security measures, such as security scanners, improved searching techniques, phone-blocking technology and a financial crime unit to target the criminal kingpins operating in prisons.</p>

<p>This has come against a backdrop of rising prison officer numbers, with more than 4,300 now recruited and staffing levels at their highest since 2012.</p>

10 prisons project gathers pace
Prisons Minister announces arrival of x-ray scanner at HMP Leeds.

A new x-ray body scanner has been installed at HMP Leeds as a project to turn around 10 of the most challenging jails gathers pace, Prisons Minister Rory Stewart announced today (Friday 4 January 2019).

Geographical groups of prisons in Yorkshire, the north Midlands and London have been selected for the project. The prisons are: Hull, Humber, Leeds, Lindholme, Moorland, Wealstun, Nottingham, Ranby, Isis and Wormwood Scrubs.
We have allocated £3.3million, with the whole of the initial £10 million due to be spent by the end of this financial year.

<p>The smuggling attempt was uncovered by Border Force officers at Heathrow Airport on 26 June 2018 when officers stopped Jeffrey Lendrum after he arrived on a flight from Johannesburg.</p>

<p>Lendrum, 57 and of no fixed UK address, was wearing a heavy jacket which officers thought was unusual due to the very warm weather conditions. When asked whether he had anything to declare, Lendrum stated he had some Fish Eagle and Kestrel eggs strapped to his body.  During a full search, he was found to be wearing a body belt concealing 19 bird eggs as well as 2 newly-hatched chicks.</p>

<p>Border Force specialist officers identified that the eggs were protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), the import trade for which is controlled by the issue of permits. Officers ensured that both the eggs and the live chicks were kept warm and quickly transported to the Heathrow Animal Reception Centre, managed by the City of London Corporation. The live chicks and the eggs were later moved to a specialist care facility at the International Centre for Birds of Prey.</p>

<p>Lendrum was arrested and the investigation passed to the National Crime Agency (NCA). Lendrum stated during an interview that his intention was to rescue the eggs after he encountered some men chopping down trees containing their nests. However in court, experts stated that a number of the eggs were from birds that nest in cliffs. Their values on the black market ranged from £2,000 to £8,000.</p>

<p>At Snaresbrook Crown Court on Tuesday (8 January) Lendrum, who has previous convictions for similar CITES offences in Canada, Brazil and Africa, pleaded guilty to attempting to import the 19 bird eggs.</p>

<p>Grant Miller, head of the national Border Force CITES team at Heathrow, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My officers are experts in their field and, in this case, their vigilance has stopped a prolific wildlife criminal in his tracks. Their intervention also ensured that the birds and eggs received the immediate care and attention that they needed.</p>

  <p>Wildlife crime is a global issue and Border Force officers play a crucial role in preventing offenders from moving the products across borders, stripping them of their illegal profits.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">We will continue to work closely with enforcement partners such as the NCA to tackle the international illegal wildlife trade which threatens the survival of endangered animals and plants.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chris Hill, NCA investigations manager Heathrow, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">This offence was clearly no accident as Lendrum had gone to great lengths to both source and then attempt to conceal the birds eggs. His claims that he was engaged in an effort to save them from deforestation did not hold water.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">Wildlife crime is a cynical business, indulged in by those who have no qualms about the environmental damage they cause as long as there is a profit to be made. This case sends a clear message that we are determined to bring cases like this  before the courts</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The importation of endangered species into the UK is strictly controlled by CITES, which is an international agreement covering more than 35,000 species of animals and plants. The Heathrow-based Border Force CITES team are specialist officers who work across the UK and who are recognised as world leaders in their field.</p>

Wildlife criminal jailed for rare bird eggs importation attempt
A man who tried to smuggle 19 rare and endangered bird eggs into the UK strapped to his body has today, 10 January, been jailed for 3 years and 1 month.
