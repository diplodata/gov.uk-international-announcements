Welcome to the new Special Envoy. Thank you for your briefing Martin. Thank you to Mark Lowcock for his assessment and welcome to our Yemeni colleagues.<\/p>\n\n<p>It’s a desperate situation, Mr President, and it is clear, as the Special Envoy set out, it can only be resolved ultimately through a political solution. I think we all agree on that. I think what the Under-Secretary-General said about the humanitarian consequences and particularly eight million people being close to starvation and one million people at risk of cholera and similar illnesses is absolutely shocking and that ought to be a spur to action for the Council. I think the international community must do whatever we can to enable the Special Envoy to develop his plan at the pace that he has just outlined to us. And I just want to say I really welcome the clarity and the elements of that plan that he set out. I hope we can, as an international community, pool all our influence and urge the parties to engage in good faith with the UN process. Although the conflict has some quite desperate humanitarian consequences, this is a solvable conflict.<\/p>\n\n<p>I think the Under-Secretary-General said if we had swift and joint action, Mr President, then we can make some very good progress. So I think that’s absolutely where we should put our efforts. And as a Council, I hope that we can encourage people to grant full and unhindered access to Yemen for the Special Envoy, for his team, for the humanitarian actors. And in that respect, the meetings that the Envoy laid out in the region, including in Sana’a with senior Houthi leaders are extremely welcome.<\/p>\n\n<p>I’d like if I may just to highlight a couple of areas for specific immediate action.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Under-Secretary-General mentioned financial pledges and I agree the scale of the generosity from Saudi Arabia and the UAE and Kuwait are all quite remarkable. We ourselves as the United Kingdom have provided a quarter of a billion dollars for this year and next. I think we all know that money alone won’t be enough. We do need to do more to get commercial supplies in. I was concerned about the foreign exchange problem, Mr President, because in Yemen a lot of the food and supplies that go in need to come from commercial sources. Humanitarian assistance can’t manage the scale required. Commercial shipping needs to be able to go in and this is vital to water and sanitation systems. So I do hope we can all find ways to urge collaboration on that.<\/p>\n\n<p>I think the second point is around access to Houthi controlled areas where we see very many severely malnourished children. We had a Presidential Statement in March that highlighted the importance of vaccination campaigns as the Under-Secretary General said.<\/p>\n\n<p>And then I think thirdly, I just want to echo the call about paying non-military public workers. Families don’t have the means to buy food. They don’t have the means to buy medicine and half of the health facilities have closed, so this is all contributing to a more desperate situation in Yemen than needs to be objectively the case.<\/p>\n\n<p>I also would now like to turn to regional stability. The impact on regional stability of this conflict is growing and it’s dangerous. It puts Saudi Arabia at risk. It puts Saudi citizens at risk. The continued Houthi missile attacks including the use of ballistic missiles at civilian targets in Saudi Arabia attract our outright condemnation. Deliberate targeting of civilian areas is abhorrent. It is against international law, against international humanitarian law.

Welcome to the new Special Envoy. Thank you for your briefing Martin. Thank you to Mark Lowcock for his assessment and welcome to our Yemeni colleagues.\nIt’s a desperate situation, Mr President, and it is clear, as the Special Envoy set out, it can only be resolved ultimately through a political solution. I think we all agree on that. I think what the Under-Secretary-General said about the humanitarian consequences and particularly eight million people being close to starvation and one million people at risk of cholera and similar illnesses is absolutely shocking and that ought to be a spur to action for the Council. I think the international community must do whatever we can to enable the Special Envoy to develop his plan at the pace that he has just outlined to us. And I just want to say I really welcome the clarity and the elements of that plan that he set out. I hope we can, as an international community, pool all our influence and urge the parties to engage in good faith with the UN process. Although the conflict has some quite desperate humanitarian consequences, this is a solvable conflict.\nI think the Under-Secretary-General said if we had swift and joint action, Mr President, then we can make some very good progress. So I think that’s absolutely where we should put our efforts. And as a Council, I hope that we can encourage people to grant full and unhindered access to Yemen for the Special Envoy, for his team, for the humanitarian actors. And in that respect, the meetings that the Envoy laid out in the region, including in Sana’a with senior Houthi leaders are extremely welcome.\nI’d like if I may just to highlight a couple of areas for specific immediate action.\nThe Under-Secretary-General mentioned financial pledges and I agree the scale of the generosity from Saudi Arabia and the UAE and Kuwait are all quite remarkable. We ourselves as the United Kingdom have provided a quarter of a billion dollars for this year and next. I think we all know that money alone won’t be enough. We do need to do more to get commercial supplies in. I was concerned about the foreign exchange problem, Mr President, because in Yemen a lot of the food and supplies that go in need to come from commercial sources. Humanitarian assistance can’t manage the scale required. Commercial shipping needs to be able to go in and this is vital to water and sanitation systems. So I do hope we can all find ways to urge collaboration on that.\nI think the second point is around access to Houthi controlled areas where we see very many severely malnourished children. We had a Presidential Statement in March that highlighted the importance of vaccination campaigns as the Under-Secretary General said.\nAnd then I think thirdly, I just want to echo the call about paying non-military public workers. Families don’t have the means to buy food. They don’t have the means to buy medicine and half of the health facilities have closed, so this is all contributing to a more desperate situation in Yemen than needs to be objectively the case.\nI also would now like to turn to regional stability. The impact on regional stability of this conflict is growing and it’s dangerous. It puts Saudi Arabia at risk. It puts Saudi citizens at risk. The continued Houthi missile attacks including the use of ballistic missiles at civilian targets in Saudi Arabia attract our outright condemnation. Deliberate targeting of civilian areas is abhorrent. It is against international law, against international humanitarian law. We call on all parties involved in the conflict to abide by their international humanitarian law obligations. And as the Under-Secretary General set out,  this is still not being done to a sufficient degree.\nBut I also want to stress that it really is a national security threat to Saudi Arabia and this in turn is driving renewed conflict on the ground. So it is vital and I hope the Council can help with this that all Member States fully implement the arms embargo that the Council has laid down.\nIn particular the UN Panel of Experts has concluded that missiles and related to material of Iranian origin has been introduced into Yemen after the imposition of the targeted to arms embargo. That in turn means Iran is in non-compliance with Security Council Resolution 2216. So we strongly urge Iran to desist from destabilizing activity and we encourage all Member States to use whatever influence they have to ensure that the supply of missiles fueling the conflict inside Yemen stops.\nMr President, I really do want to stress something the Special Envoy said about this being possible to make progress. We have within our grasp the ability to really do something to help bring this conflict to an end. I think that’s a very important contribution that the Council can make for regional and international peace and security at a time when we see so many problems on so many other issues. So I would like to conclude, Mr President, by urging all members of the Council really to put our shoulders to the wheel, to support the UN, and try and bring peace to Yemen.\nThank you.\nPublished 17 April 2018\nWorld locations\nYemen\nUK Mission to the United Nations, New York\n"},{"published":"2018-05-30 10:58:35","org":"MOD","type":"News story","title":"The injured troops revolutionising motorsport visit The Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre","url":"/government/news/the-injured-troops-revolutionising-motorsport-visit-the-defence-medical-rehabilitation-centre","html":"<main role=\"main\" id=\"content\" class=\"news-article\" lang=\"en\"><div class=\"grid-row\">\n  <div class=\"column-two-thirds\">\n    <div class=\"gem-c-title\n  \n  gem-c-title--margin-bottom-5\">\n    <p class=\"gem-c-title__context\">\n      News story\n    <\/p>\n  <h1 class=\"gem-c-title__text gem-c-title__text--long\">\n    The injured troops revolutionising motorsport visit The Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre\n  <\/h1>\n<\/div>\n\n  <\/div>\n  \n  <div class=\"column-two-thirds\">\n    \n  <p class=\"gem-c-lead-paragraph \">\n    A team of injured servicemen who are looking to make motorsport history have returned to The Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre (DMRC) at Headley Court, years after receiving support and treatment following their injuries. \n  <\/p>\n\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"grid-row\">\n  <div class=\"metadata-logo-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"column-two-thirds metadata-column\">\n        <div class=\"app-c-publisher-metadata\">\n    <div class=\"app-c-published-dates \">\n    Published 30 May 2018\n<\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"app-c-publisher-metadata__other\">\n        <dl data-module=\"track-click\">\n<dt class=\"app-c-publisher-metadata__term\">\n              From:\n            <\/dt>\n            <dd class=\"app-c-publisher-metadata__definition\" data-module=\"gem-toggle\">\n                <span class=\"app-c-publisher-metadata__definition-sentence\">\n                  <a href=\"/government/organisations/ministry-of-defence\">Ministry of Defence<\/a>\n                <\/span>\n            <\/dd>\n        <\/dl>\n<\/div>\n  <\/div>\n\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"column-one-third\">\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"grid-row\">\n  <div class=\"column-two-thirds content-bottom-margin\">\n    <div class=\"responsive-bottom-margin\">\n      <figure class=\"app-c-figure\"><img class=\"app-c-figure__image\" src=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/75296/s300_IMG_6195.jpg\" alt=\"Lt Col Tim Clarke, Ash Hall, Warren McKinlay, Martyn Compton, Jon-Allan Butterworth.\"><figcaption class=\"app-c-figure__figcaption\"><p class=\"app-c-figure__figcaption-text\">\n          Lt Col Tim Clarke, Ash Hall, Warren McKinlay, Martyn Compton, Jon-Allan Butterworth.

Before Janet goes to work she remembers that it’s bin day, but isn’t sure which one. She logs onto the council website, finds the waste page, the check collection page, enters her postcode and then selects her address. Turns out today is black bags.<\/p>\n\n<p>Janet’s daughter attends athletics club, but the club only accepts cheques. So she roots around in her drawer, looking for that chequebook she knows is somewhere there.<\/p>\n\n<p>When she gets into work at the council, rings her dad to make sure that he is OK.  She hopes her brother remembered to go and let the carer in earlier.<\/p>\n\n<p>Today Janet’s working on a performance report, but her system doesn’t have any way to access all the data it needs. So Janet spends most of the morning emailing lots of different colleagues and agencies asking for those bits of information.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now let’s take Jane.<\/p>\n\n<p>Jane works for another council. Just before she leaves for work she gets a text on her phone to remind her that today is black bag bin day.<\/p>\n\n<p>She quickly pays for her son’s school club on her phone, then another app lets her know that there is someone ringing her mum’s doorbell.  And she can see on the phone that it’s the carer.<\/p>\n\n<p>Jane remotely unlocks the door and lets the carer in.<\/p>\n\n<p>And when it comes to doing her performance report, Jane’s computer gets the data she needs from multiple other systems and automatically updates the partner agencies when she’s done.<\/p>\n\n<p>I apologise for the rather laboured examples, but I wanted to emphasise clearly just how technology is already transforming public services, offering real benefits to local government employees, the general public and the council’s bottom line.<\/p>\n\n<p>And if you take away one thing from my speech today let it be this: an understanding of digital is no longer something we can leave solely to the IT department. It doesn’t belong in the basement, it belongs in the boardroom.<\/p>\n\n<p>And most of the time people in my job, Local Government Minister, when they have this opportunity to talk to you, spend a lot of their time talking about local government finance. And indeed, as I have wondered round the conference today, and in my other meetings, that is what I have mostly been talking about.<\/p>\n\n<p>But I did want to take this opportunity today where I had all of you in the room - council leaders - to talk about technology.<\/p>\n\n<p>What I would like is to have that conversation about technology not just with the people running council IT departments but with people running councils.<\/p>\n\n<p>So today I want to talk about 3 specific things:<\/p>\n\n<p>Firstly, about how we should focus relentlessly on the needs of our citizens.<\/p>\n\n<p>Next, I’ll talk about fixing our digital plumbing, and how that opens up a world of possibilities.<\/p>\n\n<p>And lastly, I’ll outline what I am going to do in a small way to help make this happen.<\/p>\n\n<h2 id=\"part-1-services-for-citizens\">Part 1: services for citizens<\/h2>\n\n<p>Today, we now think nothing of checking the location of trains in real time, or looking round a hotel room halfway across the world before booking it.<\/p>\n\n<p>And doing all of that from something that fits in our pocket.<\/p>\n\n<p>This revolution has affected public services too.<\/p>\n\n<p>If any of you have recently renewed a passport online you’ll know the process is a delight to use. No more hanging around in the post office waiting for the photo booth.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now you do a selfie straight from your phone into the system.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are some great local examples too:<\/p>\n\n<p>Adur &amp; Worthing is piloting the Going Local service. And here GPs are directly referring can directly referring patients to the council’s social prescribing team, helping thousands of them become fitter or stop smoking.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hackney’s Pay My Rent platform, has now been used almost 70,000 times by 15,000 people.<\/p>\n\n<p>The thing that marks out these top class digital services in both public and private sector is a relentless focus on meeting the needs of their users.<\/p>\n\n<p>For example, there’s no point putting a form online if it’s so confusing someone needs to ring up to find out how to fill it in.<\/p>\n\n<p>We’ve all been there: you just want to pay your taxes to HMRC, apply for a service, perhaps to get your residents parking sorted. But after you’ve worked out what the site is trying to get you to do, sometimes you still have to print the form and email it back - or not so long ago - take 2 forms of ID to the town hall.<\/p>\n\n<p>A few years ago, Camden council found that every time someone came into a council building, it cost them nearly £14. But when they rang up it was £4 and if they did it online it cost just 30p.  By moving transactions online, they saved £3 million in just 3 years.<\/p>\n\n<p>Similarly, think of your staff. A recent study showed that up to 60% of a social worker’s time is spent typing data into a system. We should ask ourselves, is that really the best  use of such a precious resource?<\/p>\n\n<p>So getting this right has a huge impact – both in saving people’s time but also saving your council money.<\/p>\n\n<p>So as we continue to innovate and redesign services, the question you as council leaders should be asking your IT departments is this: are we thinking about how our citizens and employees live their lives?<\/p>\n\n<p>And is what we do making life easier for them, or is it forcing them to do things that suit us but actually end up costing money?<\/p>\n\n<p>Relentlessly focusing on what our users need is the way forward.<\/p>\n\n<h2 id=\"part-2-fixing-the-plumbing\">Part 2: fixing the plumbing<\/h2>\n\n<p>The next thing we need to do is having a look at our digital plumbing.<\/p>\n\n<p>And by this I want you think about an idea that we need to embrace:  the idea of “Government as Lego”.<\/p>\n\n<p>Lego bricks come in different shapes and sizes, but they all fit together and allow you to build almost anything.<\/p>\n\n<p>And that’s how we should think about our IT.<\/p>\n\n<p>Today, quite a lot of government IT is a black box. Too often, whether it’s government departments or councils, using huge, proprietary systems for each different thing they do. And they are locked into long-term, inflexible contracts, with opaque cost structures.<\/p>\n\n<p>But those at the forefront of this digital services revolution, Essex, Greater Manchester and Leeds for example, are thinking about the components of our IT that are like a utility and shared across different services.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now there are lots of bits of IT that are essentially like electricity. Electricity works to a common standard and there is no point in creating your own version.<\/p>\n\n<p>For example, Adult Social Care and Revs and Bens are very different services, but each has a few common elements - workflow, case management, payment systems. And it may not be right to have services in the same organisation paying the suppliers twice to have two things doing the same thing.<\/p>\n\n<p>And if you multiply this across the hundreds of services a council offers you can see how the costs rack up.<\/p>\n\n<p>Worse, because all these different systems might come from different providers, they can’t talk to each other and it becomes hard for a council to share the information it needs across different areas.<\/p>\n\n<p>Instead we should think about separating out those bits of IT that are used a lot across different services, the utility or electricity-like bits.<\/p>\n\n<p>And for those boring, standard components, we can use modules, or Lego blocks, that we can slot in, swap out and upgrade as we see fit.<\/p>\n\n<p>Crucially, these Lego blocks are built on common standards which means they are much cheaper and enable information to be shared much more easily.<\/p>\n\n<p>And as more and more organisations use the same common standards for bits of their IT, this encourages developers to innovate and provide new services and products based on those widely used standards.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now a simple example of this fixing the plumbing concept is moving services to the cloud<\/p>\n\n<p>Many local authorities still have services hosted on machines kept in a council warehouse – or even at times – behind the stationary cupboard or under the stairs. As one council found out a couple of years ago that can mean problems if there’s a fire in your data centre<\/p>\n\n<p>But increasing numbers of you are finding out for yourselves that digital services can be hosted for a fraction of the price in the cloud. This cloud hosting has become a commodity. For example, thanks to their cloud strategy, Aylesbury Vale has incredibly saved several million pounds.<\/p>\n\n<p>For local government, fixing the digital plumbing has the potential to be truly transformative.<\/p>\n\n<h2 id=\"part-3-what-i-will-do\">Part 3: what I will do<\/h2>\n\n<p>Lastly, I did say what I would talk a little bit of what I can do to help make all this happen.<\/p>\n\n<p>Well, I believe that we are stronger together than alone. And while the whole point of local services is that they need to differ in how they respond to local need, all of you will have a different approach to how you think you can serve your citizens best.<\/p>\n\n<p>But it makes sense for us to learn from each other, and share the common technical features that means councils don’t have to start from scratch if they want to implement a more user friendly and cost-effective digital service.<\/p>\n\n<p>And so today a group of us are launching the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://localdigital.gov.uk/declaration/\">Digital Declaration<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>This isn’t my Declaration, or the government’s - this is a joint endeavour with over 40 organisations in the sector, including Greater Manchester, West Midlands and Greater London combined authorities, <abbr title=\"Society of Local Authority Chief Executives\">SOLACE<\/abbr>, <abbr title=\"Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy\">CIPFA<\/abbr>, the LGA Government Digital Service and a cross section of local authorities of all sizes and colours from across England.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Declaration sets out our shared vision for world class public services, and invites everyone else to join the movement.<\/p>\n\n<p>It commits all of us to work together to make sure that the vision is made a reality.<\/p>\n\n<p>Words are important. But better when they are backed up with deeds.<\/p>\n\n<p>That’s why I am delighted to announce today that Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government will invest up to £7.5 million over the next two years through a new Digital Innovation Fund. This fund support and strengthen your digital capacity.<\/p>\n\n<p>So what exactly will the money be available for?<\/p>\n\n<p>Well, a report from the MJ and BT last year found that more than 80% of public sector chief executives see digital transformation as one of their key priorities. That’s fantastic.<\/p>\n\n<p>But many feel that their organisations lack the skills and capability to take full advantage.<\/p>\n\n<p>So part of this money could be used to fund key leaders from the sector to go through a new world class digital leadership programme that we are in the process of creating.<\/p>\n\n<p>You might be a Leader, Portfolio Holder, Chief Executive or <abbr title=\"Chief Financial Officer\">CFO<\/abbr>, but you will be passionate about public services and developing your digital own skills and capabilities.<\/p>\n\n<p>But beyond this, I recognise that everyone is in different places when it comes to this digital journey. Some are at the cutting edge, others are nearer the beginning of their journey.<\/p>\n\n<p>So this should not and will not be a one size fits all Fund. Before we open up the fund later this year, I want to hear from you about what would be most useful for you? Where will a small amount of extra resource make the most difference in achieving these aims?<\/p>\n\n<p>And lastly, in addition to the funding, we at the department  are creating a delivery team to support everyone who signs up to this ambitious Digital Declaration.<\/p>\n\n<p>We’ve worked with 50 to get this far. We now want to work with many more to turn this into a national movement.<\/p>\n\n<p>We want 50 to turn into 80.<\/p>\n\n<p>And 80 to turn into hundreds.<\/p>\n\n<p>Together, I know we can achieve more than we can alone. By supporting each other, and building on each other’s work we can build better services at lower cost, for our residents.<\/p>\n\n<p>Services that are efficient, modern, responsive and simple and delightful to use.<\/p>\n\n<p>Services that are built around our citizens’ needs.<\/p>\n\n<p>And services that save us money, allowing more of our precious resource to be where it should be: not in the basement cupboard of our IT department, but on the front line where it belongs.<\/p>\n\n<p>I believe this is the exciting first step of a journey.<\/p>\n\n<p>And I cannot wait to see where we get to and what we can achieve together.<\/p>\n\n<p>I have seen so much already in the short time I’ve had this job - the exciting innovation that is happening on the ground. And I hope that this small catalyst can drive us forward to ever more greater things.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n    <\/div>\n\n    <div class=\"app-c-published-dates \">\n    Published 4 July 2018\n<\/div>\n\n  <\/div>\n\n  \n<div class=\"column-one-third\">\n  \n<div class=\"gem-c-contextual-sidebar\">\n\n    \n\n\n<\/div>\n\n<\/div>\n\n<\/div>\n\n\n  <div class=\"grid-row\">\n    <div class=\"column-two-thirds\">\n        \n  <div class=\"gem-c-contextual-footer\">\n    \n\n  <\/div>\n\n\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n\n\n    <\/main>","text":"\nSpeech\nThe Local Digital Declaration\nSpeech by Local Government Minister Rishi Sunak MP at the Local Government Association Annual Conference 2018.\nPublished 4 July 2018\nFrom:\nMinistry of Housing, Communities & Local Government and Rishi Sunak MP\nDelivered on: \n4 July 2018 (Transcript of the speech, exactly as it was delivered)\nGood afternoon.\nI wanted to start by painting 2 pictures for you; a day in the lives of 2 different council employees.\nLet’s start with Janet. Before Janet goes to work she remembers that it’s bin day, but isn’t sure which one. She logs onto the council website, finds the waste page, the check collection page, enters her postcode and then selects her address. Turns out today is black bags.\nJanet’s daughter attends athletics club, but the club only accepts cheques. So she roots around in her drawer, looking for that chequebook she knows is somewhere there.\nWhen she gets into work at the council, rings her dad to make sure that he is OK.  She hopes her brother remembered to go and let the carer in earlier.\nToday Janet’s working on a performance report, but her system doesn’t have any way to access all the data it needs. So Janet spends most of the morning emailing lots of different colleagues and agencies asking for those bits of information.\nNow let’s take Jane.\nJane works for another council. Just before she leaves for work she gets a text on her phone to remind her that today is black bag bin day.\nShe quickly pays for her son’s school club on her phone, then another app lets her know that there is someone ringing her mum’s doorbell.

in the drive for green energy, clean growth and sustainability.<\/p>\n\n<p>A number of initiatives are now helping to save costs, generate income and support sustainable energy as part of the government’s Clean Growth Strategy.<\/p>\n\n<p>Lisa Pinney MBE, Chief Executive, Coal Authority, said:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">We’re delighted to support Green GB Week and committed to working with the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy to promote the government’s Clean Growth Strategy and Heat Networks Investment Project.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">We’re committed to changing our mind set from one focused on dealing with the problems of Britain’s mining legacy to one that focuses on the opportunities of our mining heritage.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">To fully realise these opportunities we’re thinking differently, working with others and being bold in our approach.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<h4 id=\"low-carbon-energy-and-water-supply-resilience\">Low carbon energy and water supply resilience<\/h4>\n\n<p>Work is already underway to make the most of these opportunities for the nation. In a surprising role reversal, abandoned coal mines are now being considered as a potential new low carbon heat source.<\/p>\n\n<p>Exciting developments such as ground based solar installations and power efficiencies on former \ncolliery sites are also saving the Coal Authority £0.7 million this year alone.<\/p>\n\n<p>Water from mine water treatment schemes, and water stored in abandoned mines, could play an important role in balancing water supplies for consumption or the environment in future: mines themselves could play a role in storing water during flood conditions.<\/p>\n\n<h4 id=\"innovations-in-mine-water-treatment\">Innovations in mine water treatment<\/h4>\n\n<p>New uses for by-products from coal mine water treatment are also among the ‘green’ innovations developed by the Coal Authority.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ochre used to be classed as waste but has been developed as a pigment for the fine arts market. It can also be used to remediate contaminated land.<\/p>\n\n<p>Iron removed from mine water during the treatment process is also being used to remove phosphorus as part of the sewage treatment process. This helps to improve water quality and support river ecology.<\/p>\n\n<p>Claire Perry, Minister for Energy and Clean Growth, said:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">The UK has led the world in cutting emissions whilst growing our economy -  with clean growth driving incredible innovation and creating hundreds of thousands of high quality jobs.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">Ten years on from the Climate Change Act, the first ever Green GB week is a time to build on our successes and explain the huge opportunities for business and young people of a cleaner economy.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">I’m delighted to see how many more businesses and organisations such as the Coal Authority are seizing this multi-billion pound opportunity to energize their communities to tackle the very serious threat of climate change.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<h4 id=\"discover-more\">Discover more<\/h4>\n\n<p>Coal mines may no longer be the feature of Britain’s landscape that they once were, but their legacy is now revealing new opportunities for our generation to explore.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Coal Authority will publish its latest Sustainability Report soon, which highlights its sustainability performance in 2017-18, during which time it:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>recycled over 3,700 tonnes of reedbed waste, reducing the environment impacts associated with landfill<\/li>\n  <li>increased its portfolio of solar arrays, taking its renewable generating capacity to 712 kW<\/li>\n  <li>reduced its carbon footprint, as part of its efficiencies programme<\/li>\n  <li>won a prestigious edie Sustainability Leaders Award 2018, for its work in finding new ways to reuse waste products, and was shortlisted for Sustainable

sustainable solutions from Britain’s coal mining legacy. \r\nPublished 16 October 2018\nFrom:\nCoal Authority\nSolar panels at one of the Coal Authority's mine water treatment scheme\nThe Coal Authority outlined how this legacy is now playing its part in the drive for green energy, clean growth and sustainability.\nA number of initiatives are now helping to save costs, generate income and support sustainable energy as part of the government’s Clean Growth Strategy.\nLisa Pinney MBE, Chief Executive, Coal Authority, said:\nWe’re delighted to support Green GB Week and committed to working with the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy to promote the government’s Clean Growth Strategy and Heat Networks Investment Project.\nWe’re committed to changing our mind set from one focused on dealing with the problems of Britain’s mining legacy to one that focuses on the opportunities of our mining heritage.\nTo fully realise these opportunities we’re thinking differently, working with others and being bold in our approach.\nLow carbon energy and water supply resilience\nWork is already underway to make the most of these opportunities for the nation. In a surprising role reversal, abandoned coal mines are now being considered as a potential new low carbon heat source.\nExciting developments such as ground based solar installations and power efficiencies on former \ncolliery sites are also saving the Coal Authority £0.7 million this year alone.\nWater from mine water treatment schemes, and water stored in abandoned mines, could play an important role in balancing water supplies for consumption or the environment in future: mines themselves could play a role in storing water during flood conditions.\nInnovations in mine water treatment\nNew uses for by-products from coal mine water treatment are also among the ‘green’ innovations developed by the Coal Authority.\nOchre used to be classed as waste but has been developed as a pigment for the fine arts market. It can also be used to remediate contaminated land.\nIron removed from mine water during the treatment process is also being used to remove phosphorus as part of the sewage treatment process. This helps to improve water quality and support river ecology.\nClaire Perry, Minister for Energy and Clean Growth, said:\nThe UK has led the world in cutting emissions whilst growing our economy -  with clean growth driving incredible innovation and creating hundreds of thousands of high quality jobs.\nTen years on from the Climate Change Act, the first ever Green GB week is a time to build on our successes and explain the huge opportunities for business and young people of a cleaner economy.\nI’m delighted to see how many more businesses and organisations such as the Coal Authority are seizing this multi-billion pound opportunity to energize their communities to tackle the very serious threat of climate change.\nDiscover more\nCoal mines may no longer be the feature of Britain’s landscape that they once were, but their legacy is now revealing new opportunities for our generation to explore.\nThe Coal Authority will publish its latest Sustainability Report soon, which highlights its sustainability performance in 2017-18, during which time it:\nrecycled over 3,700 tonnes of reedbed waste, reducing the environment impacts associated with landfill\nincreased its portfolio of solar arrays, taking its renewable generating capacity to 712 kW\nreduced its carbon footprint, as part of its efficiencies programme\nwon a prestigious edie Sustainability Leaders Award 2018, for its work in finding new ways to reuse waste products, and was shortlisted for Sustainable Business of the year\nFind out more about the Coal Authority\n"},{"published":"2018-11-25 12:57:35","org":"Number 10","type":"News story","title":"40 reasons to back the Brexit deal","url":"/government/news/40-reasons-to-back-the-brexit-deal","html":"<main role=\"main\" id=\"content\" class=\"news-article\" lang=\"en\"><div class=\"grid-row\">\n  <div class=\"column-two-thirds\">\n    <div class=\"gem-c-title\n  \n  gem-c-title--margin-bottom-5\">\n    <p class=\"gem-c-title__context\">\n      News story\n    <\/p>\n  <h1 class=\"gem-c-title__text gem-c-title__text--long\">\n    40 reasons to back the Brexit deal\n  <\/h1>\n<\/div>\n\n  <\/div>\n  \n  <div class=\"column-two-thirds\">\n    \n  <p class=\"gem-c-lead-paragraph \">\n    Here are the reasons why the deal negotiated by the Prime Minister is the right deal for the UK.\n  <\/p>\n\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"grid-row\">\n  <div class=\"metadata-logo-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"column-two-thirds metadata-column\">\n        <div class=\"app-c-publisher-metadata\">\n    <div class=\"app-c-published-dates \">\n    Published 25 November 2018\n<\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"app-c-publisher-metadata__other\">\n        <dl data-module=\"track-click\">\n<dt class=\"app-c-publisher-metadata__term\">\n              From:\n            <\/dt>\n            <dd class=\"app-c-publisher-metadata__definition\" data-module=\"gem-toggle\">\n                <span class=\"app-c-publisher-metadata__definition-sentence\">\n                  <a href=\"/government/organisations/prime-ministers-office-10-downing-street\">Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street<\/a> and <a href=\"/government/people/theresa-may\">The Rt Hon Theresa May MP<\/a>\n                <\/span>\n            <\/dd>\n        <\/dl>\n<\/div>\n  <\/div>\n\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"column-one-third\">\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"grid-row\">\n  <div class=\"column-two-thirds content-bottom-margin\">\n    <div class=\"responsive-bottom-margin\">\n      <figure class=\"app-c-figure\"><img class=\"app-c-figure__image\" src=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/default_news_organisation_image_data/file/2/s300_number10.jpg\" alt=\"placeholder\"><figcaption class=\"app-c-figure__figcaption\"><\/figcaption><\/figure><div class=\"gem-c-govspeak govuk-govspeak direction-ltr\">\n      <div class=\"govspeak\">\n<ol>\n<li>Free movement will come to an end, once and for all, with the introduction of a new skills-based immigration system.<br><br>\n<\/li>\n<li>We will take back full control of our money which we will be able to spend on our priorities such as the NHS.

It takes back control of our money, borders and laws whilst protecting jobs, security and the integrity of the United Kingdom.\n"},{"published":"2018-11-29 10:33:47","org":"Homes England","type":"Press release","title":"New statistics show number of new homes continues to rise","url":"/government/news/new-statistics-show-number-of-new-homes-continues-to-rise","html":"<main role=\"main\" id=\"content\" class=\"news-article\" lang=\"en\"><div class=\"grid-row\">\n  <div class=\"column-two-thirds\">\n    <div class=\"gem-c-title\n  \n  gem-c-title--margin-bottom-5\">\n    <p class=\"gem-c-title__context\">\n      Press release\n    <\/p>\n  <h1 class=\"gem-c-title__text gem-c-title__text--long\">\n    New statistics show number of new homes continues to rise\n  <\/h1>\n<\/div>\n\n  <\/div>\n  \n  <div class=\"column-two-thirds\">\n    \n  <p class=\"gem-c-lead-paragraph \">\n    Homes England has today published its latest official housing statistics, which show the number of homes being built in England continued to rise in the first half of this financial year.\n  <\/p>\n\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"grid-row\">\n  <div class=\"metadata-logo-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"column-two-thirds metadata-column\">\n        <div class=\"app-c-publisher-metadata\">\n    <div class=\"app-c-published-dates \">\n    Published 29 November 2018\n<\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"app-c-publisher-metadata__other\">\n        <dl data-module=\"track-click\">\n<dt class=\"app-c-publisher-metadata__term\">\n              From:\n            <\/dt>\n            <dd class=\"app-c-publisher-metadata__definition\" data-module=\"gem-toggle\">\n                <span class=\"app-c-publisher-metadata__definition-sentence\">\n                  <a href=\"/government/organisations/homes-england\">Homes England<\/a>\n                <\/span>\n            <\/dd>\n        <\/dl>\n<\/div>\n  <\/div>\n\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"column-one-third\">\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"grid-row\">\n  <div class=\"column-two-thirds content-bottom-margin\">\n    <div class=\"responsive-bottom-margin\">\n      <figure class=\"app-c-figure\"><img class=\"app-c-figure__image\" src=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/assets/placeholder-a6e35fc15d4bfcc9d0781f3888dc548b39288f0fe10a65a4b51fef603540b0c5.jpg\" alt=\"placeholder\"><figcaption class=\"app-c-figure__figcaption\"><\/figcaption><\/figure><div class=\"gem-c-govspeak govuk-govspeak direction-ltr\">\n      <div class=\"govspeak\">\n<p>Between 1 April and 30 September 2018, programmes managed by Homes England* started building 15,766 homes on site and completed a total of 15,704 homes.
